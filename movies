I highly recommend:
    [x] Oslo
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11790674/
        - Director: Bartlett Sher
        - because of: soundtrack composer
        - quite an interesting take on the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. The main theme is how each side struggles with the desire to collaborate to resolve the conflict, but then the strings that pull them back: their society, their own propaganda, their own dogma, etc. The movie tries not to get political, creates a mood of drama and brings life to the otherwise soulless political figures. I learned about the movie when Zoe Keating announces she was working on the soundtrack, and if a good musician works on a movie, it should be a good movie, at least I think so, so I gave it a try and it delivered. A delight to watch.
    [x] In the mood for love
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118694/
        - Director: Kar-Wai Wong
        - because of: soundtrack composer
        - One of the best movies I've watched, mainly because of the music, but the science are so well made, the story is told in a quite fascinating way, and the suspension, the struggle, and the dilemma all contribute so much to the quality. Umebayashi's theme for the sound track is just penetrating and enriches the whole experience so much. This is the stroy of two neighbors whose spouses cheat with each other, they find out, and in the process of trying to figure out what has happened, that develop feelings for each other. The ethical questions that it brings up, and the way that it challenges the boundaries of the social norms is quite interesting.
    [x] twelve angry men
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/
        - Recommender: Hossein
        - story of a jury that are discussing a murder case and one of them is very skeptical, preventing them from reaching a conclusion. It shows the frustration of the rest of the group members very nicely, and tries to show the value in the stubbornness of that one person. It all seems to end well, which is generally over-optimistic.
    [x] shoplifters
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075192
        - Director: Kore-eda Hirokazu
        - country: Japan
        - year: 2018
        - review:
            quite a strong story of a family who steals from shops to make a living. Brings up a ton of interesting questions about social norms and their relation with law and ethics. The exploration of gray areas that are often left un-discussed is very interesting.
    [x] Born to Be Blue
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2133196/
        - Country: Canada
        - review:
            - story of the life of Chet Baker, very emotional and touching, with a a lot of good music. I've watched it in Calgary International Film Festival. The US released version has some scenes removed.
    [x] The Lobster
        - recommender: Ali O
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3464902
        - very thought provoking piece on the concept of relationship, from personal and societal point of view. Very dark, and very hard. It takes a ton of energy to watch and guaranteed to bring the mood down by a few levels. It is almost impeccable, and takes on extreme absurdity to deliver a message, and this effort is only second to Salo. The refrain from a closed ending is also great.
I recommend:
    [x] Simon Schama's Power of Art
        - mini series about painters who has social impact
    [x] Broker
        - director: Hirokazu Kore-eda
        - Country: South Korea
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Interesting Korean movie about parents leaving their kids for adoption and a couple of guys trying to sell kids to potential adopters and make money. It hints at deeper social and structural problems that exist and that probably the adoption procedure not being a good solution on top of it not even being run well. In some sense it is similar to "the shoplifters" from 2018 Japan, shoplifters is quite better told I think.
    [x] Decision to Leave
        - director: Park Chan-wook
        - country: South Korea
         - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Very nicely made movie similar to the themes in "in the mood for love", but in a mystery movie. The stroy progresses in a fascinating way and keeps the tension going. The mixing of times and places into each other is done very nicely, though hard to follow, makes for an engaging watch.
    [x] My Policeman,
        - director: Michael Grandage
        - country: United Kingdom
         - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - very touching movie, with quite unique ending. The question that the woman brings up at the end is very interesting: I wonder what did "I" miss by doing so.
    [x] The Alpinist
        - review:
            - 2021-11-10: A truly remarkable movie about a free solo climber from Squamish, Marc-André Leclerc, who has made even Alex Honnold amazed: The Alpinist.  In his blog he writes: "As a young climber it is undeniable that I have been manipulated by the media and popular culture and that some of my own climbs have been subconsciously shaped through what the world perceives to be important in terms of sport. Through time spent in the mountains, away from the crowds, away from the stopwatch and the grades and all the lists of records I've been slowly able to pick apart what is important to me and discard things that are not."

    [x] The Banshees Of Inisherin, Martin McDonagh | United Kingdom, Ireland, USA, North American Premiere
        - recommmender: Kaivan
        - Quite an interesting movie about two guys in a rural place in Ireland where one of them suddenly struggles with the purpose of his life and stops being friends with the other guy, and what comes up next between them.
    [x] Leila's Brothers - برادران لیلا
        - Recommender: Kaivan
        - happens in current day Iran and aims to explain the everyday pain that the ordinary people are going through. The story is built slowly and nicely, adding pieces one by one to provide context. The film is rather long and the reality of it is too painful to go through. I got a headache after watching it. One of the nice things about the story is how it brings in each person's point of view and tries to explain why everyone does what they do. It's probably the only movie I've seen that portraits how women are treated by people around them, and not just the systemic problems that exist. Although the main theme of the movie is about poverty and how it causes bad decisions that in turn result in more poverty, and one person's tough realistic approach to counter it, it doesn't shy away from bringing up front the everyday cultural and otherwise problems such as extreme gender inequality, family issues, body-shaming, ignorance and dogma against mental health problems, superstitions, toxic social norms and interactions, as well as systemic problems which all contribute to the overall dire situation. The movie is extremely honest, which makes is very painful to watch, but is highly recommended.
    [x] CODA
        - recommender: Maren
        - a very well made and touching movie about the child of a deaf couple and her troubles in choosing an identity between her deaf family and community and the hearing world. One of the best scenes in the movie is the part where her parents are at her music performance and it puts the audience in their shoes.
    [x] Fight Club
        - recommender: Hossein
        - Seems like this should be a movie for teenagers, but it has something more to offer. It wasn't until recently that I was made aware of the very heavy domination of male desires in the movie which makes sense.
    [x] Requiem for a dream
        - recommender: Hossein
        - After the first time I watches the movie I didn't remember any of the story or the characters or the scenes, I was completely absorbed in the soundtrack. I haven't had such feelings before or after this. It was a unique experience. The music so perfectly sits in between the frames and takes you away with it. I had to watch the movie for a second time so that at least I could say I have watched it. It's about drug addiction and the problems that it causes. The soundtrack is so much better than the movie though
    [x] The underground railroad (TV mini series)
        - based on the book with the same name by Colson Whitehead
        - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6704972/
I think it's a nice one:
    [x] Alice, Darling, Mary Nighy | Canada, USA, World Premiere
         - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - An interesting movie about psychological abuse in relationship. A bit slow, but nicely represents the problem.
    [x] A Jazzman’s Blues, Tyler Perry | USA, World Premiere
         - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - About a black guy who fell in love with a black girl who passed as white back in the old days in the south, his mother was a singer and his brother and dad played jazz, and their struggles. Has good music.
    [x] Raymond & Ray, Rodrigo García | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - About two older guys whose dad who bullied them in childhood has passed away and still gives them hard time after he is dead. It hints at the dad struggling with figuring out the meaning of life etc and as such being an asshole to his kids and wife, but super nice to everyone else.
    [x] The Swimmers, Sally El Hosaini | United Kingdom, World Premiere Opening Night Film
        - Recommmender: Sima
        - About two Syrian sisters who escape the war in their country and eventually find refuge in Germany and try to participate in Olympics from there.
    [x] The Menu, Mark Mylod | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - review:
            Story of a group of people who go on an island to experience a very expensive dinner where they realize they are all going to die, as part of the menu. It gives a little sense of midsommar but orders of magnitude better told and produced. One of the interesting things about it is the attempt to portray different classes of people.
    [x] Empire of Light, Sam Mendes | United Kingdom, USA, Canadian Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - about a woman dealing with abuse and taking pills and trying to keep her job and falling in love with a black guy, with hints of anti-racism. it was ok.
    [x] Women Talking, Sarah Polley | USA, International Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Quite an interesting movie about women in a rural place getting raped by the men of their place and "have to" forgive them. Women are tired of it and are exploring their options: forgive, fight, leave. The discussions that goes into the decision making and the interactions are very interesting. The conclusion is not as much, but provides a great perspective.
    [x] The Wonder, Sebastián Lelio | United Kingdom, Ireland, Canadian Premiere"
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Touching storytelling about a girl who has not eaten anything for four months and believes she does not need to eat because she's been fed from heaven. Makes the news and a nurse and a nun are asked to watch her for two weeks. Touches on some finding root causes of some societal problems caused by beliefs, brings up the question of the value of truth being told and some other important questions.
    [x] Patience Stone
        - Apparently happening in Afghanistan where a young lady is stuck with her ill and immobile husband at home, and the attacking forces try getting into the house and will kill her husband and if they find him.
    [x]  Have You Another Apple? - بازم سیب داری؟
        - recommmender: Ali O
        - review:
            - Quite a long and slow movie about an imaginary tribe in a point of time in Iran that has taken over Iran and is abusing its people. The interactions of the characters is very thought provoking.
There's something in it:
    [x] On the Come Up, Sanaa Lathan | USA, World Premiere
        - A young girl getting into rap world, and trying to make some money while also wanting to be herself. It doesn't have much to deliver, but it tries.
    [x] The Hummingbird, Francesca Archibugi | Italy, France, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - If you're interested in the topic it's an interesting movie. About the guys trying to create a direct link from Kansas to NY stock exchange for faster trading. Pretty fun.
    [x] The Whale, Darren Aronofsky | USA, North American Premiere
        - Recommmender: Ali O
        - review:
            - It tries to say something, but it's not clear to me what! About an unimaginably fat guy who can barely move, who teaches an online course, who has left his wife and daughter to pursue the love of another guy who has died and his sister helping him, and him being close to dying himself, trying to do something good with his life, including helping his own daughter.
    [x] Holy Spider, Ali Abbasi | Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, Canadian Premiere
        - Fetrat recommended this.
        - Iranian movie about a religious serial killer in the holy city of Mashhad going around town and murdering sex workers, his justification of his acts for himself, the government's point of view, and the public's reaction.
    [x] And Your Mother Too (Y Tu Mamá También)
        - about two teenage boys who slowly learn to grow up, and meet an older girl who is dying of cancer but doesn't tell anyone.
Good entertainment/fun and/or well-made:
    [x] Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Rian Johnson | USA, World Premiere
        - mystery, fun, entertaining, well made, engaging story.
    [x] Knives out
        - mystery, fun, entertaining, the sequel was better I think.
    [x] What’s Love Got To Do With It?, Shekhar Kapur | United Kingdom, World Premiere
        - not the 1993 film. About a Pakistani guy raised in UK going through an arranged marriage and his childhood friend filming the process. It shows some of the inner cultures and hints at other current societal problems. The story is a bit predictable but since it doesn't go for too long it's fine
    [x] Bros, Nicholas Stoller | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Finally a romantic average gay movie that doesn't make you cringe. There is a lot of scenes that goes parallel to an average romantic straight movies, so as such it doesn't have anything to offer, but seems like it is mostly not made by straight folks.
    [x] Wendell & Wild, Henry Selick | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - A very fun animation about a kid whose parents die and two monsters from hell come back and try to sell a cream that would make the dead alive and what happens next.
    [x] babylon (2022)
        - recommmender: Ali O
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10640346/
        - Good entertainment. The story of a young man working for a super wealthy person throwing an extravaganza party and a young lady sneaking in, the two forming an alliance and go through life together and somehow make it. It is a lot of entertainment.
    [x] Cruella
        - Recommmender: Sima
        - Good entertainment. Fantasy movie about a girl trying to grow in the fashion world.
    [x] Triangle of Sadness, Ruben Östlund | Sweden, United Kingdom, USA, France, Greece, North American Premiere
        - Recommmender: Ali O
        - review:
            - A cute movie about a model couple who goes on a cruise trip, the ship sinks, a few people survive in a no-man's land and form a "society" where one of the servers, a Mexican woman, becomes the leader because she's the only one who knows how to collect and prepare food. The hierarchy that forms in that "society", and the ending.
    [x] just 6.5 (AKA 6.5 per meter) - متری شیش‌و‌نیم
        - Recommmender: Ali S
        - teview:
            An Iranian mostly action movie about a group of police officers fighting drug dealers. An improvement over older movies in the same category is the addition of personality to the dealers and the officers, making them a bit more imperfect, just very slightly less black and white.
    [x] Parasite
        - country: South Korea
        - mostly a horror movie but well made.
    [x] The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg | USA, World Premiere
        - Entertaining. About a boy in a jewish family becoming a director, his family, and troubles in life.
    [x] Yesterday
        - Recommmender: Kaivan: it's entertaining
        - was fun to watch, about a world that Beatles are removed from everyone's memory except for an Indian guy in England  who recreates their songs. A bit too simplistict.
I've watched it:
    [x] Fallen Leaves
        - Happening in Finland, an alcoholic construction worker and a hard working store staff fall in love. The story doesn't go very deep but the interactions are on a much deeper level than an average love story. The film manages to somehow cheer the audience up through a rather grim story.
    [x] The Royal Tenenbaums
        - director: Wes Anderson
        - review: ok for wasting time. Not extremely engaging, not bad either, neither a profound story or topic. just about how important family is and stuff. classic and cliche.
    [x] Asteroid City
        - recommender: Ali O
        - review: OK entertainment. Nothing exciting.
    [x] The Good Nurse, Tobias Lindholm | USA, World Premiere
        - crime mystery, not much of a mystery though. A nurse in ICU killing patients by overdosing them and the hospitals suspecting him just letting him go so that they don't face charges.
    [x] The Lost King, Stephen Frears | United Kingdom, World Premiere
        - not a comedy. about a woman struggling at work and in life and getting obsessed with finding the remains of a king, Richard III, and finding joy in that.
    [x] The Woman King, Gina Prince-Bythewood | USA, World Premiere
        - about an army of women fighting for their king and gaining power
    [x] Blueback, Robert Connolly | Australia, World Premiere
        - about a mother and daughter saving the coastal lives of Australia. It was a bit dramatic, but not too much. The scenery was nice, but also some shots were just absord.
    [x] Catherine Called Birdy, Lena Dunham | United Kingdom, World Premiere
        - It was entertaining. Was focused on supporting women's independence and freedom of choice in a lighthearted and witty manner, but generally was very bland in doing so. It tried to exaggerate really hard at showing diversity in a time and place that it didn't exist at all, making it more of a fantasy movie than anything else. Something nice to dream about.
    [x] The Greatest Beer Run Ever, Peter Farrelly | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - Good for killing time. About a guy who delivered a bunch of beer to his buddies in Vietnam war. Based on truth! Good for killing time, a bit funny, a bit sad, gets a bit anti-war but never seriously.
    [x] The Son, Florian Zeller | United Kingdom, North American Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - About a kid whose parents are professionals in NYC and separated, the kid has trouble, probably suicidal, and lives with the mom, goes lives with the dad, the dad tries to be a good dad but doesn't know how, and compares himself with his own dad who was abusive.
    [x] Causeway, Lila Neugebauer | USA, World Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - review:
            - about a girl in Louisiana who has come back from army after an injury, struggling with her family's past and trying to escape from reality by getting redeployed.
    [x] One Fine Morning, Mia Hansen-Løve | France, Canadian Premiere
        - Recommmender: TIFF 2022
        - review:
            - the story of a woman whose dad at an old age has some neurodegenerative disease and they story of her daily life, happy and sad, with all the ups and downs. Nothing special, just daily life and emotions. The Father was a much more interesting movie in terms of dealing with dementia, but with focus on the dad, rather than the doughter. So in that sense they are different topics.
    [x] Taste of cherry
        - About a guy trying to commit suicide. Trying to remove the taboo of suicide and start a conversation about it, with an open ending.
    [x] Tar
        - Kaivan recommended this. about a musician who is sort of abusive and goes on being abusive and finally breaks down.
    [x] Meet the parents
        About a guy who is ready to marry his girlfriend but learns that he has to win over her very peculiar dad first. It brings up the issue of trying to act positively in the face of adversity. It loosely reminded me also of a part from Tuesdays with Murie: if you treat people like criminals, you'll turn them into a bunch of criminals. The story is very holywoody though. It ends with the dad suddenly coming to his senses and everything changes for the best. There were parts that I identified with the dada and also with the guy.
    [x] The Fountain
        - By the same director and composer as the Requiem For A Dream, it resembles a lot of the music, you can tell right away that it is the same composer, but then the movie is rather boring. I probably have to give it another shot so that I can appreciate the story too.
Not a good one:
    [x] Allelujah, Sir Richard Eyre | United Kingdom, World Premiere
        - about nurses and doctors trying to save a hospital in a small town
    [x] DEAF U
        - Short movie series about deaf college students at the only deaf university in US. It is a reality show type, quite cheesy and very salacious. But it shows interesting aspects deaf culture and their inside problems. How it is similar and how it is different. A few things that stood out were the "elite" status within the deaf community, and also how hard of hearing and deaf are (not) accepting each other etc. The closedness, the separation from the rest of the society and some other challenges that exist.
    [x] the wisdom of trauma
        - Recommender: Layla
        - review:
            About a clinician psychologist taking over a Freudian approach and relating every problem we face to a trauma that has happened at our childhood. The part that talks about the importance of paying attention to trauma's is quite interesting, but that's minimal and it quickly starts building a neo-religion around it and starts preaching.
    [x] Stutz
        - Recommender: Ramin
        - review: movie about Phill Stutz, a psychiatrist. A patient goes to make a movie about his psychiatrist. There are a lot of awkward moments, some interesting conversations, and the patient tries really hard to make this about something, but generally fails.
    [x] Jerry & Marge Go Large
        - Recommender: Ramin S
        - about a retired couple finding a hole in michigan/boston lottery and winning millions. It is more of a fun entertaining movie than anything else. They try to throw "mathy" jargon to make it sound complicated, but fail quite bad.
I highly discourage:
    [x] Midsommar
        - Randomly watched this in the cinema. The movie is very long and tries really hard to convince you for the first 45-60 minutes that is not a horror movie. But then there are all the elements of a horror movie there, and even when it starts being a horror movie, it still tries to pretend it is not. And this goes on until the end. Probably the worst movie I've watched so far.

            - it is good for entertainment. In that sense similar to Babylon (2022) but not as extravagant. The point is not quite clear, it seems like the writer wants to criticize the "high society" but at the same time thinks it is not that bad and kinda longs for it. And then it kinda misses the whole topic and just explores a few themes. Same with religion and spirituality.
