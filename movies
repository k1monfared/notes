            - review: quite an interesting take on the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. The main theme is how each side struggles with the desire to collaborate to resolve the conflict, but then the strings that pull them back: their society, their own propaganda, their own dogma, etc. The movie tries not to get political, creates a mood of drama and brings life to the otherwise soulless political figures. I learned about the movie when Zoe Keating announces she was working on the soundtrack, and if a good musician works on a movie, it should be a good movie, at least I think so, so I gave it a try and it delivered. A delight to watch.

            - review: One of the best movies I've watched, mainly because of the music, but the science are so well made, the story is told in a quite fascinating way, and the suspension, the struggle, and the dilemma all contribute so much to the quality. Umebayashi's theme for the sound track is just penetrating and enriches the whole experience so much. This is the stroy of two neighbors whose spouses cheat with each other, they find out, and in the process of trying to figure out what has happened, that develop feelings for each other. The ethical questions that it brings up, and the way that it challenges the boundaries of the social norms is quite interesting.

            - review: story of a jury that are discussing a murder case and one of them is very skeptical, preventing them from reaching a conclusion. It shows the frustration of the rest of the group members very nicely, and tries to show the value in the stubbornness of that one person. It all seems to end well, which is generally over-optimistic.

            - review: very thought provoking piece on the concept of relationship, from personal and societal point of view. Very dark, and very hard. It takes a ton of energy to watch and guaranteed to bring the mood down by a few levels. It is almost impeccable, and takes on extreme absurdity to deliver a message, and this effort is only second to Salo. The refrain from a closed ending is also great.

            - review: It starts quite intense and it says so, but with a bit less intensity, or maybe I got used to it after a while. It builds a lot of characters with a lot of details in the first 45 minutes. There is a lot of switch backs between fantasy and reality, it stays on both sides as extremes and tries to contrast them as much as it can but then interwoves them very very tightly. The movie is a sort of commentary on societal fixedness on things in general, how hard it is to change points of views and see beyond repetetive things we are used to see.

            - review: Interesting Korean movie about parents leaving their kids for adoption and a couple of guys trying to sell kids to potential adopters and make money. It hints at deeper social and structural problems that exist and that probably the adoption procedure not being a good solution on top of it not even being run well. In some sense it is similar to "the shoplifters" from 2018 Japan, shoplifters is quite better told I think.

In his blog he writes: "As a young climber it is undeniable that I have been manipulated by the media and popular culture and that some of my own climbs have been subconsciously shaped through what the world perceives to be important in terms of sport. Through time spent in the mountains, away from the crowds, away from the stopwatch and the grades and all the lists of records I've been slowly able to pick apart what is important to me and discard things that are not."

            - review: happens in current day Iran and aims to explain the everyday pain that the ordinary people are going through. The story is built slowly and nicely, adding pieces one by one to provide context. The film is rather long and the reality of it is too painful to go through. I got a headache after watching it. One of the nice things about the story is how it brings in each person's point of view and tries to explain why everyone does what they do. It's probably the only movie I've seen that portraits how women are treated by people around them, and not just the systemic problems that exist. Although the main theme of the movie is about poverty and how it causes bad decisions that in turn result in more poverty, and one person's tough realistic approach to counter it, it doesn't shy away from bringing up front the everyday cultural and otherwise problems such as extreme gender inequality, family issues, body-shaming, ignorance and dogma against mental health problems, superstitions, toxic social norms and interactions, as well as systemic problems which all contribute to the overall dire situation. The movie is extremely honest, which makes is very painful to watch, but is highly recommended.

        [x] Requiem for a dream
            - recommender: Hossein
            - review: After the first time I watches the movie I didn't remember any of the story or the characters or the scenes, I was completely absorbed in the soundtrack. I haven't had such feelings before or after this. It was a unique experience. The music so perfectly sits in between the frames and takes you away with it. I had to watch the movie for a second time so that at least I could say I have watched it. It's about drug addiction and the problems that it causes. The soundtrack is so much better than the movie though

It could have said a bit more, but I think that's also the point of the movie to not say more in some way. Good watch.

            - review: has certain points about life goals and lifestyle, but the stroy itself is tooooooo dramatized, the details don't match, and gets boring at times. I don't say it tries too hard, but gets close to trying too hard. Worth the entertainment.

            - recommender: Marjan M
            - review: it is a fantasy movie. the caharacter are Persians, the story happens in Winnipeg, but the story doesn't go far. It somewhat is similar to "a girl walks home alone at night" in terms of style, but not the same genre. It has some nice bits, but overall not that engaging.

            - review: it is good for entertainment. In that sense similar to Babylon (2022) but not as extravagant. The point is not quite clear, it seems like the writer wants to criticize the "high society" but at the same time thinks it is not that bad and kinda longs for it. And then it kinda misses the whole topic and just explores a few themes. Same with religion and spirituality.

            - review:
                - the story of a woman whose dad at an old age has some neurodegenerative disease and they story of her daily life, happy and sad, with all the ups and downs. Nothing special, just daily life and emotions. The Father was a much more interesting movie in terms of dealing with dementia, but with focus on the dad, rather than the doughter. So in that sense they are different topics.

        [x] Meet the parents
            - review: About a guy who is ready to marry his girlfriend but learns that he has to win over her very peculiar dad first. It brings up the issue of trying to act positively in the face of adversity. It loosely reminded me also of a part from Tuesdays with Murie: if you treat people like criminals, you'll turn them into a bunch of criminals. The story is very holywoody though. It ends with the dad suddenly coming to his senses and everything changes for the best. There were parts that I identified with the dada and also with the guy.
        [x] The Fountain
            - review: By the same director and composer as the Requiem For A Dream, it resembles a lot of the music, you can tell right away that it is the same composer, but then the movie is rather boring. I probably have to give it another shot so that I can appreciate the story too.

            - review: Short movie series about deaf college students at the only deaf university in US. It is a reality show type, quite cheesy and very salacious. But it shows interesting aspects deaf culture and their inside problems. How it is similar and how it is different. A few things that stood out were the "elite" status within the deaf community, and also how hard of hearing and deaf are (not) accepting each other etc. The closedness, the separation from the rest of the society and some other challenges that exist.
        [x] the wisdom of trauma
            - Recommender: Layla
            - review:
                - About a clinician psychologist taking over a Freudian approach and relating every problem we face to a trauma that has happened at our childhood. The part that talks about the importance of paying attention to trauma's is quite interesting, but that's minimal and it quickly starts building a neo-religion around it and starts preaching.

            - review: about a retired couple finding a hole in michigan/boston lottery and winning millions. It is more of a fun entertaining movie than anything else. They try to throw "mathy" jargon to make it sound complicated, but fail quite bad.
    - I highly discourage:
        [x] Midsommar
            - review: Randomly watched this in the cinema. The movie is very long and tries really hard to convince you for the first 45-60 minutes that is not a horror movie. But then there are all the elements of a horror movie there, and even when it starts being a horror movie, it still tries to pretend it is not. And this goes on until the end. Probably the worst movie I've watched so far.

                - Synopsis
                    - Me, Maryam, the Children and 26 Others is a feature fiction film by Iranian filmmaker Farshad Hashemi that offers an intimate, female-centered reflection on everyday life and loneliness in post-COVID Iran.
                    - The story follows Mahboube, who decides to rent out her house to a film crew. The extra income is a welcome relief, and having some company around seems like a good idea. However, things don’t go as smoothly as she hoped. The large crew quickly turns her home upside down and she struggles to cope with the intrusion. Mahboube voices her frustrations to the director, who reassures her that everything will be put back in place. Yet, she begins to realize that the chaos in her home isn’t the real issue.
                    - The COVID years have left Mahboube feeling disconnected, from herself and from others. As she watches the crew film a short story about a crumbling marriage, she begins to reflect on her own life and what has been missing.
                    - This quietly powerful film takes audiences on a profound journey of self-discovery, exploring themes of love, loneliness, friendship, and the lingering impact of isolation. Ultimately, it reminds us that healing and connection can only be found together. – MS
