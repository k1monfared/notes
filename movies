        [x] Broker, Hirokazu Kore-eda | South Korea, Canadian Premiere
            - Interesting Korean movie about parents leaving their kids for adoption and a couple of guys trying to sell kids to potential adopters and make money. It hints at deeper social and structural problems that exist and that probably the adoption procedure not being a good solution on top of it not even being run well. In some sense it is similar to "the shoplifters" from 2018 Japan, shoplifters is quite better told I think.
        [-] Brother, Clement Virgo | Canada, World Premiere
        [x] Bros, Nicholas Stoller | USA, World Premiere
            - Finally a romantic average gay movie that doesn't make you cringe. There is a lot of scenes that goes parallel to an average romantic straight movies, so as such it doesn't have anything to offer, but seems like it is mostly not made by straight folks.

            - Very nicely made movie similar to the themes in "in the mood for love", but in a mystery movie. The stroy progresses in a fascinating way and keeps the tension going. The mixing of times and places into each other is done very nicely, though hard to follow, makes for an engaged watch.

        [x] My Policeman, Michael Grandage | United Kingdom, World Premiere
            - very touching movie, with quite unique ending. The question that the woman brings up at the end is very interesting: I wonder what did "I" miss by doing so.

            - Quite an interesting movie about women in a rural place getting raped by the men of their place and "have to" forgive them. Women are tired of it and are exploring their options: forgive, fight, leave. The discussions that goes into the decision making and the interactions are very interesting. The conclusion is not as much, but provides a great perspective.
        [x] The Wonder, Sebastián Lelio | United Kingdom, Ireland, Canadian Premiere"
            - Touching storytelling about a girl who has not eaten anything for four months and believes she does not need to eat because she's been fed from heaven. Makes the news and a nurse and a nun are asked to watch her for two weeks. Touches on some finding root causes of some societal problems caused by beliefs, brings up the question of the value of truth being told and some other important questions.
My list
    [x] Taste of cherry
        - About a guy trying to commit suicide. Trying to remove the taboo of suicide and start a conversation about it, with an open ending.
    [x] Patience Stone
        - Apparently happening in Afghanistan where a young lady is stuck with her ill and immobile husband at home, and the attacking forces try getting into the house and will kill her husband and if they find him.
    [x] babylon (2022)
        - The story of a young man working for a super wealthy person throwing an extravaganza party and a young lady sneaking in, the two forming an aliance and go through life together and somehow make it. It is a lot of entertainment.
    [x] The Alpinist
        - review:
            - 2021-11-10: A truly remarkable movie about a free solo climber from Squamish, Marc-André Leclerc, who has made even Alex Honnold amazed: The Alpinist.  In his blog he writes: "As a young climber it is undeniable that I have been manipulated by the media and popular culture and that some of my own climbs have been subconsciously shaped through what the world perceives to be important in terms of sport. Through time spent in the mountains, away from the crowds, away from the stopwatch and the grades and all the lists of records I've been slowly able to pick apart what is important to me and discard things that are not."
        - Director:
            - Peter Mortimer
            - Nick Rosen
        - tag: outdoor, mountain, climbing, free-solo
    [x] Oslo
        - imdb: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11790674/
        - quite an interesting take on the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. The main theme is how each side struggles with the desire to collaborate to resolve the conflict, but then the strings that pull them back: their society, their own propaganda, their own dogma, etc. The movie tries not to get political, creates a mood of drama and brings life to the otherwise soulless political figures. I learned about the movie when Zoe Keating announces she was working on the soundtrack, and if a good musician works on a movie, it should be a good movie, at least I think so, so I gave it a try and it delivered. A delight to watch.
    [x] Cruella
        - good entertainment.
    [x] In the mood for love
        - One of the best movies I've watched, mainly because of the music, but the science are so well made, the story is told in a quite fascinating way, and the suspension, the struggle, and the dilemma all contribute so much to the quality. Umebayashi's theme for the sound track is just penetrating and enriches the whole experience so much. This is the stroy of two neighbors whose spouses cheat with each other, they find out, and in the process of trying to figure out what has happened, thet develop feelings for each other. The ethical questions that it brings up, and the way that it challenges the boundaries of the social norms is quite interesting.
suggestions
    Ali
        [x]  Have You Another Apple? - بازم سیب داری؟
            - Quite a long and slow movie about an imaginary tribe in a point of time in Iran that has taken over Iran and is abusing its people. The interactions of the characters is very thought provoking.
        [] EO
        [x] The Whale, Darren Aronofsky | USA, North American Premiere
            - About an unimaginably fat guy who can barely move, who teaches an online course, who has left his wife and daughter to pursue the love of another guy who has died and his sister helping him, and him being close to dying himself, trying to do something good with his life, including helping his own daughter.
        [x] Triangle of Sadness, Ruben Östlund | Sweden, United Kingdom, USA, France, Greece, North American Premiere
            - A cute movie about a model couple who goes on a cruise trip, the ship sinks, a few people survive in a no-man's land and form a "society" where one of the servers, a Mexican woman, becomes the leader because she's the only one who knows how to collect and prepare food. The hierarchy that forms in that "society", and the ending.
    Fetrat
        [] Cafe Transit
        [x] Holy Spider, Ali Abbasi | Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, Canadian Premiere
            - Iranian movie about a religious serial killer in the holy city of Mashhad going around town and murdering sex workers, his justification of his acts for himself, the government's point of view, and the public's reaction.
    Layla
        [x] the wisdom of trauma
            - About a clinician psychologist taking over a Freudian approach and relating every problem we face to a trauma that has happened at our childhood. The part that talks about the importance of paying attention to trauma's is quite interesting, but that's minimal and it quickly starts building a neo-religion around it and starts preaching.
    Kaivan
        [x] Tar
            - about a musician who is sort of abusive and goes on being abusive and finally breaks down.
        [] Hiroshima mon amour
        [x] The Banshees Of Inisherin, Martin McDonagh | United Kingdom, Ireland, USA, North American Premiere
            - Quite an interesting movie about two guys in a rural place in Ireland where one of them suddenly struggles with the purpose of his life and stops being friends with the other guy, and what comes up next between them.
        [x] Leila's Brothers - برادران لیلا
            - happens in current day Iran and aims to explain the everyday pain that the ordinary people are going through. The story is built slowly and nicely, adding pieces one by one to provide context. The film is rather long and the reality of it is too painful to go through. I got a headache after watching it. One of the nice things about the story is how it brings in each person's point of view and tries to explain why everyone does what they do. It's probably the only movie I've seen that portraits how women are treated by people around them, and not just the systemic problems that exist. Although the main theme of the movie is about poverty and how it causes bad decisions that in turn result in more poverty, and one person's tough realistic approach to counter it, it doesn't shy away from bringing up front the everyday cultural and otherwise problems such as extreme gender inequality, family issues, body-shaming, ignorance and dogma against mental health problems, superstitions, toxic social norms and interactions, as well as systemic problems which all contribute to the overall dire situation. The movie is extremely honest, which makes is very painful to watch, but is highly recommended.
    Ramin:
        [x] Stutz
            - review: movie about Phill Stutz, a psychiatrist. A patient goes to make a movie about his psychiatrist. There are a lot of awkward moments, some interesting conversations, and the patient tries really hard to make this about something, but generally fails.

    Christine:
        [x] Meet the parents
            About a guy who is ready to marry his girlfriend but learns that he has to win over her very peculiar dad first. It brings up the issue of trying to act positively in the face of adversity. It loosely reminded me also of a part from Tuesdays with Murie: if you treat people like criminals, you'll turn them into a bunch of criminals. The story is very holywoody though. It ends with the dad suddenly coming to his senses and everything changes for the best. There were parts that I identified with the dada and also with the guy.
    Ali S:
        [x] just 6.5 (AKA 6.5 per meter) - متری شیش‌و‌نیم
            An Iranian mostly action movie about a group of police officers fighting drug dealers. An improvement over older movies in the same category is the addition of personality to the dealers and the officers, making them a bit more imperfect, just very slightly less black and white.
        [] Life and a Day - ابد و یک روز
    Hossein
        [x] Fight Club
            - Seems like this should be a movie for teenagers, but it has something more to offer. It wasn't until recently that I was made aware of the very heavy domination of male desires in the movie which makes sense.
        [x] Requiem for a dream
            - After the first time I watches the movie I didn't remember any of the story or the characters or the scenes, I was completely absorbed in the soundtrack. I haven't had such feelings before or after this. It was a unique experience. The music so perfectly sits in between the frames and takes you away with it. I had to watch the movie for a second time so that at least I could say I have watched it. It's about drug addiction and the problems that it causes. The soundtrack is so much better than the movie though.
        [x] The Fountain
            - By the same director and composer as the Requiem For A Dream, it resembles a lot of the music, you can tell right away that it is the same composer, but then the movie is rather boring. I probably have to give it another shot so that I can appreciate the story too.
