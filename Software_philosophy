Software philosophy

I like to be able to tweak the software that I use, and be able to audit it to make sure it does what it does. It hinges mostly on free software principles. Unfortunately, the society tends to ignore the power that the everyday software have on their lives, and a lot of malpractices have become common practice simply because companies like google have made it a lot easier for the developers to just include some black box code into their software. I have to admit that I have used some of them in my website at times when I didn't know what I was doing, but have removed them as soon as I became a bit more literate.

What I like in software are:
- I should be able to read the source code and audit that it doesn't do anything that it is not supposed to do. This is the part that most people tend to ignore. Any app on your computer or phone can potentially
    - log your keyboard and send the logs to the server
    - install other apps to do things you haven't agreed
    - change your settings so that it keeps running in the background
    - log your data traffic
    - take photos, record video, record sounds when you haven't agreed
    - or anything else that your phone is capable of

Why so sus?
    By default, you want to give mic permission for example to your voice assistant so that when you say "hey siri", or whatever else you say, it can respond, but that also means it is recording when you are on a call, when you are talking to your friend across the table in a coffee shop, when you are snoring in bed, or when you're singing in the shower. Initially the companies who created these apps collected all the data they could, and told you nothing whatsoever. Now, after a lot of free software enthusiasts and consumer rights activists have done a lot of work, google/apple/amazon etc claim that they are not interested in collecting and they would never ever keep those recordings. They might even give you options to opt out, or to request to delete your data. A huge part of that is due to GDPR (https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en) in Europe and CCPA (https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) in California. 
    Funny thing? those laws do not apply to people who do not reside in EU and CA. So, you might be asking facebook to remove some data you don't want them to have, but they can refuse if you don't live in California! You might think these are just hypothetical, they would never abuse such things, right? after all, they cannot just go around and do whatever they want, there are laws. Well, the simple answer is that no, there is no laws, and they can do whatever they want. CCPA and GDPR don't even start to touch the main problems, and even more, they are not really enforceable, in the sense that they don't have any preventative power. What has happened since they have gone into effect is that a company as big as facebook calculates: if I can use such and such data and use it for ads I will be able to make this much more money, if I do this discretely enough, no one will notice and I will make billions off of users' data, but in the worst case that some whistle blowers expose me, the fine is not even 1% of what I make in excess. So it is a no brainier to go ahead and use that data. This is the common theme at least in the past 10 years or so. And more than that has been the theme for example since google maps started collecting user data to become the best map app without anything given back to the users. Ah, yes, you might argue that the users get to use the app for free! Not so much, since if you don't share your data (not that you have a choice but there are ways), then the app becomes practically unusable. 
    So, it is not as free as you might think. One more example: spotify records your voice and uses it to determine your mood, and to recommend music and podcasts that "match" your mood. It sounds all good, you might think what's better than an app that automatically knows what I'm in mood for and plays the songs for me already?! Well, nothing wrong on the top layer, but how do you trust it actually "knows" your mood? And how do you know what it recommends makes your mood "better"? What if you are depressed and it starts playing songs that make you more and more depressed? What if you end up committing suicide after a few days, while if you hadn't been exposed to those songs, and probably some podcasts that promoted/normalized suicide? Unfortunately, there is no way to hold spotify, or any other company for that matter, accountable. 
    These things are just happening everyday, and they have become the norm. Fortunately, you have some limited power, nowadays android/ios let you manage "some" permissions. These things haven't come for free. a decade ago I used to be called a conspiracy theorist when I was talking about these things, today, they are on most phones, but still they aren't a fraction of what is needed. Just think about your home electricity company wanted to install microphones in every room in your house "to better serve you" electricity, or that your house water provider wanted to put cameras all over your house "for your own safety", how would you react to that? Now, next time you want to allow spotify, an app that is meant to "play" music, give permission to "record" things, think what they would want to do with those recordings. 
    The problem is much much deeper that this though. There are all sorts of talks about "not transferring data to servers" and keeping them on the user's device etc. That is just a distraction, facebook has spearheaded what they call "federated learning" while it is just a label for distributed computing, it has nothing to do with privacy. It is in essence doing all they want to do anyways, but just on your phone, they use your phone's storage and your phone's processing power, and probably your network, to do all they were doing before. The raw data might be sensitive and be important to keep it private, but processing it on my premises and abusing it as before doesn't solve anything.

Any ways, I am going to avoid using apps that
    - are not open source
    - are not free (free software, not free as in zero cost)
    - show me ads or worse personalized ads
    - ask for permissions that are not aligned with what they are supposed to do.
    - have a long unreadable terms of service
    - have some sort of recommender system and won't allow me to disable it
    - have some sort of ranking of things that I don't know the logic of it and cannot modify it to my needs
        - a good example of this is college rankings. some websites like usnews have a completely nonsense ranking that they publish each year. It is just who have paid them more to go higher in an arbitrary ranking that somewhat aligns with general public's undertanding of colleges. i.e. something biased, made more biased by the influence of money. On the other hand, a website like phds.org allows you to decide what factors go into a ranking and how much they matter, so that you can get a ranking that makes sense to you. Of course, there are still quuestions about validity of their data and how biased that is, but at least it is one step closer. what phds does should become the norm for any recommender system and ranking
