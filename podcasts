    - What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law
        - review:
            - Started as "What trump can teach us about con law" when Trump was in office and discussed the topics of American constitution as daily events in US politics unfolded.
            - It tried to be neutral for the first few episodes but quickly gave up, which I think lost a lot of republican listeners, then went into its echo chamber.
            - The unfolding of US constitution in the context of every day events was probably the only way I, and many other people, would ever listen to someone explain the constitution, and the summary of it all was that the constitution is so fucked up and we are all just hoping that the person in power has good intents, and Trump has shown how fragile that assumption is. I wish there was a similar version of it about Canadian constitution.

    - Huberman Lab
        - by Andrew Huberman
        - recommended by Parham
        - review:
            - A leading neuroscientist trying to distill the recent advancements in neurosceince research into understandable actions by average people.
            - I've only listened to one full episode,
            - I like the parts he talks about the reproduced results and what it could mean for an everyday routine. Also the parts he says I'm not an expert in this or that but the research says this.
            - I don't like that every episode is so long and so dense with a lot of repeats, as if one trying to drill into your head their manifesto.
            - I also don't like the advertisements, they sound very ingenuine.
Good entertainment/fun and/or story telling is nice:
    - Invisibila
        - by NPR
        - recommended by Hannah
        - review:
            - It used to be really good investigative journalism about topics that are not clearly defined but roughly about our pre-conceptions and forces that shape our lives, whatever that means. The first few seasons were really good, but then it turned into a nor-cal hippy style wishy washiness.
