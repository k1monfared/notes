# Should vs. Does

You're at the lake with your 3-year-old. You want to fish. He wants to play with you. You brought toys, snacks, a little chair for him. He should be able to entertain himself for a bit. You set him up, cast your line, and within two minutes he's pulling at your arm. You redirect him. He's back. You're thinking: "I set everything up. He has what he needs. He should let me have this."

And maybe he should. But he's 3. So what actually produces a dad who gets to fish? Maybe you give him his own little rod and he buys into the game — now you're fishing together and he's thrilled. Maybe you spend twenty minutes throwing rocks with him first, and once he's genuinely full of you he wanders off to dig in the mud on his own. Maybe you find the one puddle with tadpoles in it and that's his whole afternoon. The point is: until the kid is genuinely happy, you're not happily fishing. You stop insisting he should be fine. You find what actually makes him fine.

Or: you need a reference letter from your advisor for grad school. The deadline is in two weeks. You've asked twice. They said yes both times but nothing's appeared. You're thinking: "This is their job. They agreed to do it. I shouldn't have to manage my own supervisor."

And you're right. But your advisor has 40 students, three grants due, and a inbox with 200 unread emails. What actually produces a letter before the deadline? You write a draft yourself. You include bullet points of what you worked on together. You attach the submission link, the deadline, and the address it needs to go to. You hand them a package they can finish in half an hour. You stop waiting for a busy person to find an hour they don't have. You make the task small enough to actually happen.

There's a pattern here. In both cases, there's a need, and there's a story about how that need *should* be met. The story is often correct — morally, logically, by any reasonable standard. But it's not producing the outcome.

The mental move is noticing the gap between those two things and making a deliberate switch. You stop asking "how should this work?" and start asking "given reality as it is, how *can* this work?"

When you make that switch, a few things change at once. The world stops being a collection of agents who are failing you and becomes a system with variables. You stop optimizing the path you expected and start identifying the conditions that make the outcome possible. You choose actions based on whether they increase the probability of getting what you need — not whether they send the right message or honor the correct sequence.

The "should" doesn't go away. You don't disprove it. You don't morally abandon it. You just stop using it as a planning tool.

Here's where it gets more interesting — and more uncomfortable.

Your partner doesn't clean. You both live there. They should notice the mess. You shouldn't have to ask. It's not your job to manage them. All true. But what actually produces a clean kitchen? A specific, concrete ask at a specific time. Or: you do it yourself because the clean kitchen is what you actually want, and you separate that from the scorekeeping. You stop trying to produce fairness. You decide what you're actually optimizing for.

A customer is yelling at your team. They agreed to the terms. They're being unreasonable. You did nothing wrong. Also true. But angry people don't process logic. What de-escalates? Acknowledgment before explanation. A small immediate concession that costs you little. A callback from someone senior. Being right doesn't produce retention. Changing the emotional variables does.

You want to change someone's mind about something you care about. The facts are clear. They should see it. If they just read the right sources they'd agree. But people don't update from being told they're wrong. What actually produces belief change? Questions that surface contradictions they already feel. Stories more than statistics. Agreement on shared values before introducing divergent conclusions. Ten conversations, not one. You stop trying to win the argument. You start engineering the conditions under which minds actually move.

That last example should make you uncomfortable. "Engineering the conditions under which minds move" — is that education or manipulation? Is this whole framework just Machiavellianism with better branding?

It's a fair question, and I think the honest answer is that the framework itself is amoral. It's a cognitive tool. Treat the world as a system. Identify conditions. Act on causal leverage. A hostage negotiator uses this. A con artist uses this. The move is identical.

So where's the line?

It's not inside the framework. It's in the answer to a different question: *what do I refuse to treat as a variable?*

There's a difference between removing "should" as your *goal* and removing it as your *boundary*. When you stop optimizing for fairness in the kitchen, you're letting go of fairness as the target — the clean kitchen is the target. But you haven't permitted yourself to do anything to get it. You haven't decided your partner's feelings are just another obstacle to route around.

The Machiavellian move is collapsing both. Removing "should" as goal *and* as constraint. Other people's autonomy, wellbeing, consent — all just variables. All just friction to minimize.

The version of this that isn't sociopathic maintains a hard distinction: other people's needs are constraints, not obstacles. You can adapt to how people actually work without exploiting how they work. You can understand that someone doesn't respond to emails without using that knowledge to manipulate them. You can understand how belief change works without engineering someone's views against their interests.

The tool doesn't tell you where the line is. You have to bring that yourself. But I think the line is answerable: it's wherever you start treating people's autonomy as something to get around rather than something to work within.

The short version of all of this:

You have a need. You notice you're reasoning from how the world *should* work. You switch to how it *does* work. You act accordingly.

That's it. No moral arc. No narrative. Just a mode switch — temporary, deliberate, and bounded by what you refuse to do to get there.
