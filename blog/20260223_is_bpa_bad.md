# Is BPA Bad?

[نسخه فارسی](#نسخه-فارسی)

---

## English Version

[DISCLAIMER: I don't have any expertise in these matters, this is just a summary of my very limited search and my understanding of the matter based on that search. The reason I got interested in this topic is that my mom asked whether this is true or not, and shall she be worried. Here is my take.]

### Summary

BPA (Bisphenol A) and BPS (Bisphenol S) are chemicals in plastics, can linings, and thermal receipt paper. They are endocrine disruptors: they can mimic estrogen and interfere with the body's hormonal systems. The short answer to "is BPA bad?" is: *probably somewhat, but the science is more uncertain than most headlines suggest, and what's worth doing about it depends on who you are.*

**What the evidence clearly supports:**
- BPA and BPS are present in nearly everyone's body and have real biological activity: they bind to hormone receptors
- Animal and cell studies show a range of health effects
- Fetal and infant exposure is the most legitimate concern
- Dietary exposure (canned food, food-contact plastics) matters more than receipts for most people
- Occupational exposure for cashiers handling hundreds of receipts daily is a genuine concern
- Reducing unnecessary plastic use is a reasonable precaution

**Where the science is genuinely uncertain:**
- Whether current human exposure levels actually cause disease: most evidence comes from animal studies or observational data, not controlled human trials
- "BPA-free" labeling is largely illusory: BPS has similar hormone-disrupting properties, just different and incompletely understood kinetics
- The EU and US regulatory limits differ by 12,000×, not because one has better data, but because they apply different philosophies to the same uncertain evidence

**The honest bottom line:**
These chemicals are probably not harmless, particularly for developing organisms. But the more alarming framing in public health advocacy, that touching a receipt is dangerous or that BPA alone explains waves of chronic disease, outpaces what the human evidence actually supports. Reduce dietary plastic exposure where you reasonably can, don't panic about occasional receipts, and apply more caution if pregnant.


**What are BPA and BPS?**

Bisphenol A (BPA) [has been used since the 1950s](https://www.britannica.com/science/bisphenol-A) to make:
- Hard polycarbonate plastics (water bottles, food containers)
- Epoxy resin linings in metal cans
- Thermal receipt paper
- Medical devices, dental sealants, CDs, eyeglass lenses

Bisphenol S (BPS) emerged as a "safer" replacement for BPA when concerns were raised, but is structurally similar and found in:
- "BPA-free" thermal receipt paper
- Some plastic products marketed as BPA-free
- Food contact materials

**Why the Concern?**

These chemicals are endocrine disruptors, i.e. they can mimic hormones (particularly estrogen) and potentially interfere with:
- Reproductive development
- Metabolic function
- Neurological development
- Immune system function

**The Scale of Exposure:**

- [Approximately 93% of Americans have detectable BPA in their bodies](https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/biomonitoring-bisphenol-bpa)
- Global production: [Over 6 billion pounds of BPA annually](https://www.britannica.com/science/bisphenol-A)
- BPA is found in nearly universal human biomonitoring studies
- [Cashiers and retail workers show elevated levels](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4927604/)


### Current Regulatory Status

**European Union (Strict Approach):**
- In 2023, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [lowered the tolerable daily intake by 20,000-fold](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.6857) to a new limit of 0.2 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day
- In 2024, [the EU banned BPA in all food contact packaging](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety-news-0/commission-adopts-ban-bisphenol-food-contact-materials-2024-12-19_en)
- BPS is also included in restrictions

**United States (Permissive Approach):**
- [FDA maintains the 1980s-era standard: 50 micrograms per kilogram per day](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application). This is approximately 12,000 times more permissive than the EU standard
- [BPA banned in baby bottles (2012)](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application), but based on "market abandonment" not safety determination
- The FDA states ["BPA is safe at current levels occurring in foods"](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application)

**The Gap:**

The divergence between EU and US regulatory positions reflects fundamentally different approaches to uncertain science: the EU emphasizes precaution when evidence is unclear, while the US requires stronger proof of harm before restricting chemicals.


### Scientific Evidence: What We Know

**1. Widespread Presence and Exposure**

*Established facts:*
- [BPA detected in 93% of US population (CDC biomonitoring)](https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/biomonitoring-bisphenol-bpa)
- Multiple exposure routes: diet, dermal contact, dust inhalation
- [Cashiers have approximately 2–3 times higher urinary BPA levels than general population](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4927604/)
- [Receipt paper contains 250–1,000 times more BPA than a can of food](https://www.ewg.org/research/bpa-coats-cash-register-receipts)

**2. Thermal Receipt Paper as an Exposure Source**

*Confirmed findings:*
- [Approximately 80% of US receipts contain BPA or BPS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621184/)
- In thermal paper, BPA/BPS are in "free form" (not chemically bound)
- This allows easy transfer to skin and other surfaces
- [Studies confirm dermal absorption occurs from receipt handling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5453537/)

**3. Dermal Absorption Mechanisms**

*What studies show:*
- [BPA is absorbed through skin: 25% absorption rate in 24 hours](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- [BPS has lower absorption: 0.4% in 24 hours (60x slower than BPA)](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- [Hand sanitizer/lotion dramatically increases absorption (up to 185x)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206219/)
- [BPA from skin contact remains in body longer than ingested BPA (days vs. hours)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9210257/)
- [Only 2.2% of dermally applied BPA becomes systemically available](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9210257/)

**4. Transfer to Other Objects**

*Documented:*
- [BPA/BPS transfers from receipts to paper currency, cards, and other items in wallets](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621184/)
- Secondary exposure from contaminated objects is measurable
- [Studies have found BPA contamination on paper money](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621184/)

**5. Biological Activity**

*Uncontested:*
- [BPA and BPS bind to estrogen receptors](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1203574109)
- [They show estrogenic activity in laboratory assays](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1203574109)
- Both can interact with other hormone receptors (thyroid, androgen)
- [The binding affinity is weak: thousands of times weaker than natural estrogen](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1203574109)



### Scientific Evidence: What Remains Uncertain

**1. Human Health Effects at Real-World Exposure Levels**

*The evidence problem:*
- Most health effects are demonstrated in animal studies or cell cultures
- Studies use doses often higher than typical human exposure
- Human epidemiological studies show associations but cannot prove causation
- Confounding factors (diet, lifestyle, socioeconomic status) are difficult to separate

*Claimed effects with uncertain human evidence:*
- Obesity and metabolic syndrome
- Type 2 diabetes
- Reproductive dysfunction and infertility
- Certain cancers (breast, prostate)
- Neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD, learning disabilities)
- Cardiovascular disease

*The fundamental challenge:* Animal studies suggest these effects, human observational studies show correlations, but establishing causation in humans at real-world doses remains difficult.

**2. The Reproducibility Problem**

*Why this matters:*

Reproducibility is fundamental to scientific credibility. If a finding cannot be independently replicated, it may be:
- A statistical artifact (false positive)
- An artifact of specific experimental conditions
- Subject to publication bias (only "positive" results published)
- Influenced by researcher expectations or methodology

*The BPA situation:*
- A [2004 Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found "no consistent affirmative evidence for low-dose BPA effects"](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.7713)
- Many headline-grabbing BPA studies have never been independently reproduced
- Different laboratories using different methods get inconsistent results
- This doesn't prove BPA is safe, but it means we can't be confident about specific claimed effects

*Funding and bias concerns:*
- [Industry-funded studies tend to find BPA safer (about 90% find no effect)](https://www.science.org/content/article/bpa-safety-war-battle-over-evidence)
- [Academic/government studies tend to find harm (about 90% find effects)](https://www.science.org/content/article/bpa-safety-war-battle-over-evidence)
- This could indicate:
  - Industry suppression or manipulation
  - Better study design in industry or academic research (standardized protocols)
  - Different research questions being asked
  - Publication bias in academic and/or industry research

The scientific community remains divided on how to interpret this pattern.

**3. BPS as a Replacement: Mixed Picture**

*What we know:*
- BPS was introduced as "safer" with minimal safety testing
- [BPS has similar hormone-disrupting properties to BPA](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4816743/)
- [BPS absorbs through skin 60 times slower than BPA](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- BUT: [BPS is metabolized more slowly, so more remains in active form](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6792388/)
- Net effect on human health: genuinely uncertain

*The key question:* Is slower absorption but longer persistence better or worse than faster absorption with quicker metabolism? We don't have a clear answer.

**4. Dose-Response Relationship: Non-Monotonic Concerns**

*Classical toxicology assumption:* Higher dose = greater effect

*Endocrine disruption reality:* [May not follow this pattern](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3365860/)
- Hormones operate at extremely low concentrations
- Small doses might have effects that large doses don't[^nmdr]
- Timing of exposure may matter more than amount
- Traditional toxicology methods may miss these effects

*Why this creates uncertainty:*
- Traditional safety testing assumes monotonic dose-response
- If BPA doesn't follow this pattern, current safety limits may be irrelevant
- But non-monotonic effects are harder to study and replicate

**5. Actual Individual Risk from Receipts**

*What's overstated:*
- "10 seconds of handling exceeds safe thresholds" - misleading because EFSA thresholds are extremely precautionary
- "4 minutes to wash it off" - widely cited but poorly sourced
- Receipts presented as major individual risk when dietary exposure is typically larger

*What's real:*
- Occupational exposure for cashiers handling hundreds of receipts daily
- Cumulative effect of receipts plus dietary sources
- Hand sanitizer dramatically amplifying absorption



### Understanding Scientific Uncertainty

**What Does It Mean to Be in a "Grey Area"?**

Scientific uncertainty doesn't mean "we know nothing." It means we have:
- Plausible biological mechanisms
- Suggestive but not definitive evidence
- Contested interpretations of existing data
- Different expert conclusions based on the same evidence

**For BPA/BPS, the grey area includes:**

1. **Mechanistic plausibility:** We know these chemicals CAN interact with biological systems
2. **Animal evidence:** Effects are seen in laboratory animals
3. **Observational associations:** Higher BPA correlates with certain diseases in humans
4. **Causal uncertainty:** We can't definitively say BPA causes these diseases in humans at real-world exposures

**How to Reason in Grey Areas:**

*Option 1: Demand definitive proof before action*
- Wait for conclusive human evidence
- Risk missing genuine harms during delay
- Potential population-wide exposure continues

*Option 2: Apply precautionary principle*
- Act on plausible concern even without definitive proof
- Risk unnecessary restrictions on useful chemicals
- May incur economic costs for uncertain benefits

*Option 3: Proportional precaution (most scientifically defensible)*
- Strongest precaution for most vulnerable (pregnant women, infants)
- Moderate reduction strategies for general population
- Continued research to resolve uncertainties
- Regular reassessment as evidence evolves

**The Current Scientific Consensus (such as it is):**

Most independent scientists would agree:
- BPA/BPS are not inert: they have biological activity
- Precautionary reduction of exposure is reasonable
- Fetal and infant exposure is most concerning
- Adult exposure from occasional receipts is probably minimal risk
- Dietary sources are larger concern than receipts for most people
- More and better human studies are needed

Most independent scientists would disagree on:
- Whether current population exposures cause measurable disease
- What the "safe" level actually is
- Whether BPS is better, worse, or equivalent to BPA
- How much weight to give animal studies vs. human studies



### Final Conclusions

**Balanced Scientific Assessment:**

1. **For pregnant women and young children:** Precaution is well-justified. Evidence is sufficient to recommend minimizing exposure through all routes (dietary and dermal). The precautionary principle is appropriate here because:
   - Developmental windows are particularly vulnerable
   - Effects may be irreversible
   - Cost of avoidance is relatively low

2. **For adults (general population):** Risk from occasional receipt handling is likely overstated in public health messaging. Primary concern should be dietary exposure. The evidence supports:
   - Reasonable reduction efforts (prefer fresh over canned, glass over plastic)
   - Not panicking about occasional exposures
   - Recognizing uncertainty remains

3. **For occupational workers (cashiers):** This is a legitimate occupational health concern requiring workplace protections:
   - Daily handling of hundreds of receipts
   - Cumulative exposure over years
   - Often combined with hand sanitizer use
   - Employer responsibility to provide safer alternatives

4. **About BPS:** "BPA-free" labeling is misleading: BPS appears to have similar concerns, just different kinetics.

**What the Global Disease Burden Estimates Mean:**

Claims like ["127 million cases of metabolic disease attributable to bisphenols"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725025379) are:
- Model-based projections, not counted cases
- Based on assumed causal relationships
- Useful for policy prioritization
- Not equivalent to proven individual causation



### Practical Recommendations

#### For Everyone:

**Priority 1: Reduce Dietary Exposure (Most Important)**

- Choose fresh or frozen foods over canned when possible
- Use glass or stainless steel containers instead of plastic
- Never microwave food in plastic containers
- Reduce consumption of packaged and processed foods
- Avoid plastic water bottles (especially in hot cars)
- Look for cans labeled "BPA-free lining" (but recognize they may use BPS)

**Priority 2: Manage Receipt Exposure (Moderate Importance)**

- Request electronic receipts when offered
- Decline paper receipts when you don't need them
- If keeping receipts:
  - Store them in a separate envelope/pocket (not loose in wallet)
  - Fold printed side inward
  - Keep away from cash and cards
- Wash hands with soap and water after handling receipts
- **Never** use hand sanitizer immediately before handling receipts
- Always wash hands before eating after touching receipts
- Don't give receipts to children to hold or play with

**Priority 3: General Plastic Reduction**

- Avoid plastics marked with recycling code #7 (polycarbonate)
- Don't use damaged or scratched plastic containers
- Replace plastic baby bottles with glass or stainless steel
- Use wax paper or glass instead of plastic wrap when possible

#### For Pregnant Women and Parents of Young Children:

All of the above, plus:
- Be more strict about avoiding canned foods for baby food
- Use glass baby bottles exclusively
- Avoid plastic teething toys (choose silicone, wood, or natural rubber)
- Don't allow children to handle receipts
- During pregnancy, minimize unnecessary plastic exposure
- Choose BPA/BPS-free products when available (recognizing limitations)

#### For Cashiers and Retail Workers:

- Request employer switch to phenol-free receipt paper
- Wear gloves if handling many receipts daily
- Minimize contact time with receipts
- Don't use hand sanitizer immediately before handling receipts
- Wash hands thoroughly before eating or breaks
- Don't place receipts on hot food containers
- Advocate for electronic receipt systems

#### What NOT to Worry About:

- Touching a single receipt occasionally: risk is minimal
- Shopping at stores: no need to avoid retail environments
- Incidental contact with plastic: focus on high-exposure sources
- Perfect elimination: not realistic or necessary

[^nmdr]: In classical toxicology, harm scales with dose: more substance means more harm, producing a straight *monotonic* curve. Hormones work differently: they act as *signals*, and receptors respond differently at different signal intensities. A small dose of BPA may mimic a weak estrogen signal and trigger a cellular response; a large dose may instead cause the body to *downregulate* (suppress) those same receptors, canceling the effect. The result: low doses can produce measurable changes in studies while high doses don't, the opposite of what traditional safety testing expects. Since regulatory limits are set by testing high doses and assuming lower doses are proportionally safer, this pattern, if real, could mean current standards miss genuine low-dose harms. The mechanism is well-established in hormone biology generally; whether it applies to BPA at real-world human exposures remains actively debated.

## نسخه فارسی

[تذکر مهم: من هیچ تخصصی در این موضوعات ندارم، این فقط خلاصه‌ای از جستجوی بسیار محدود من و درک من از موضوع بر اساس آن جستجو است. دلیل علاقه‌مندی من به این موضوع این بود که مادرم پرسید آیا این موضوع درست است یا نه، و آیا باید نگران باشد. این برداشت من است.]

### خلاصه

بی‌پی‌آ (بیسفنول آ) و بی‌پی‌اس (بیسفنول اس) موادی شیمیایی هستند که در پلاستیک‌ها، پوشش قوطی‌ها، و کاغذهای حرارتی رسید استفاده می‌شوند. این مواد اختلال‌گر هورمونی هستند که می‌توانند استروژن را تقلید کرده و با سیستم‌های هورمونی بدن تداخل کنند. پاسخ کوتاه به «آیا بی‌پی‌آ مضر است؟» این است: *احتمالاً تا حدی، اما علم بسیار نامطمئن‌تر از آن چیزی است که اکثر تیترها نشان می‌دهند، و اینکه چه کاری ارزش انجام دارد به این بستگی دارد که چه کسی هستید.*

**آنچه شواهد به‌وضوح پشتیبانی می‌کند:**

- بی‌پی‌آ و بی‌پی‌اس تقریباً در بدن همه افراد حضور دارند و فعالیت بیولوژیکی واقعی دارند: آنها به گیرنده‌های هورمونی متصل می‌شوند
- مطالعات حیوانی و سلولی طیفی از اثرات سلامتی نشان می‌دهند
- مواجهه جنینی و نوزادی نگران‌کننده‌ترین است
- مواجهه غذایی (غذاهای کنسرو شده، پلاستیک‌های تماس با غذا) برای بیشتر مردم مشکل بزرگ‌تری نسبت به رسیدها است
- مواجهه شغلی صندوقدارانی که روزانه صدها رسید را دستکاری می‌کنند یک نگرانی واقعی است
- کاهش مصرف غیرضروری پلاستیک یک احتیاط منطقی است

**جایی که علم واقعاً نامشخص است:**

- اینکه آیا سطوح مواجهه انسانی فعلی واقعاً بیماری ایجاد می‌کنند: بیشتر شواهد از مطالعات حیوانی یا داده‌های مشاهده‌ای است، نه آزمایش‌های کنترل‌شده انسانی
- برچسب «بدون بی‌پی‌آ» عمدتاً گمراه‌کننده است: بی‌پی‌اس خواص اختلال هورمونی مشابهی دارد، فقط سینتیک متفاوت و ناقصی شناخته‌شده
- حدود نظارتی اتحادیه اروپا و ایالات متحده ۱۲۰۰۰ برابر اختلاف دارند، نه به این دلیل که یکی داده‌های بهتری دارد، بلکه به این دلیل که فلسفه‌های متفاوتی را بر همان شواهد نامشخص اعمال می‌کنند

**خلاصه صادقانه:**

این مواد شیمیایی احتمالاً بی‌ضرر نیستند، به‌ویژه برای ارگانیسم‌های در حال رشد. اما قالب‌بندی هشداردهنده‌تر در حمایت از سلامت عمومی، که لمس یک رسید خطرناک است یا که بی‌پی‌آ به‌تنهایی موجی از بیماری‌های مزمن را توضیح می‌دهد، از آنچه شواهد انسانی واقعاً پشتیبانی می‌کنند فراتر می‌رود. مواجهه غذایی با پلاستیک را تا جایی که منطقی است کاهش دهید، نگران رسیدهای گاه‌به‌گاه نباشید، و اگر باردار هستید بیشتر احتیاط کنید.



### زمینه و بستر موضوع

**بی‌پی‌آ و بی‌پی‌اس چیست؟**

بیسفنول A (بی‌پی‌آ) [از دهه ۱۹۵۰](https://www.britannica.com/science/bisphenol-A) برای ساخت موارد زیر استفاده می‌شود:

- پلاستیک‌های سخت پلی‌کربنات (بطری آب، ظروف غذا)
- پوشش رزین اپوکسی در قوطی‌های فلزی
- کاغذ رسید حرارتی
- وسایل پزشکی، مواد دندان‌پزشکی، سی‌دی‌ها، عدسی عینک

بیسفنول S (بی‌پی‌اس) به‌عنوان جایگزین "ایمن‌تر" برای بی‌پی‌آ هنگامی که نگرانی‌ها مطرح شد، ظهور کرد، اما از نظر ساختاری مشابه است و در موارد زیر یافت می‌شود:

- کاغذ رسید حرارتی "بدون بی‌پی‌آ"
- برخی محصولات پلاستیکی که به‌عنوان بدون بی‌پی‌آ بازاریابی می‌شوند
- مواد تماس با غذا

**چرا نگرانی وجود دارد؟**

این مواد شیمیایی اختلال‌گر هورمونی هستند - می‌توانند هورمون‌ها (به‌ویژه استروژن) را تقلید کنند و احتمالاً با موارد زیر تداخل کنند:

- رشد تولیدمثلی
- عملکرد متابولیک
- رشد عصبی
- عملکرد سیستم ایمنی

**مقیاس مواجهه:**

- [تقریباً ۹۳ درصد آمریکایی‌ها بی‌پی‌آ قابل شناسایی در بدنشان دارند](https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/biomonitoring-bisphenol-bpa)
- تولید جهانی: [بیش از ۶ میلیارد پوند بی‌پی‌آ در سال](https://www.britannica.com/science/bisphenol-A)
- بی‌پی‌آ در تقریباً همه مطالعات زیست‌سنجی انسانی یافت می‌شود
- [صندوقداران و کارگران خرده‌فروشی سطوح بالاتری نشان می‌دهند](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4927604/)



### وضعیت مقررات کنونی

**اتحادیه اروپا (رویکرد سختگیرانه):**

- در سال ۲۰۲۳، سازمان ایمنی غذایی اروپا (EFSA) [دریافت روزانه قابل تحمل را ۲۰۰۰۰ برابر کاهش داد](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.6857)
- حد جدید: ۰.۲ نانوگرم به ازای هر کیلوگرم وزن بدن در روز
- در سال ۲۰۲۴، اتحادیه اروپا [بی‌پی‌آ را در تمام بسته‌بندی‌های تماس با غذا ممنوع کرد](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety-news-0/commission-adopts-ban-bisphenol-food-contact-materials-2024-12-19_en)
- بی‌پی‌اس نیز در محدودیت‌ها گنجانده شده است

**ایالات متحده (رویکرد مجاز):**

- [FDA استاندارد دهه ۱۹۸۰ را حفظ می‌کند: ۵۰ میکروگرم به ازای هر کیلوگرم در روز](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application)
- این تقریباً ۱۲۰۰۰ برابر مجازتر از استاندارد اتحادیه اروپا است
- [بی‌پی‌آ در بطری‌های شیرخوری ممنوع شد (۲۰۱۲)](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application)، اما بر اساس "ترک بازار" نه تعیین ایمنی
- FDA اعلام می‌کند ["بی‌پی‌آ در سطوح فعلی موجود در غذاها ایمن است"](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application)

**شکاف:**

واگرایی بین موضع‌های نظارتی اتحادیه اروپا و ایالات متحده منعکس‌کننده رویکردهای اساساً متفاوت به علم نامشخص است: اتحادیه اروپا بر احتیاط هنگامی که شواهد نامشخص است تأکید می‌کند، در حالی که ایالات متحده قبل از محدود کردن مواد شیمیایی به اثبات قوی‌تر آسیب نیاز دارد.



### شواهد علمی: آنچه می‌دانیم

- این امکان انتقال آسان به پوست و سطوح دیگر را می‌دهد
- [مطالعات جذب پوستی از دستکاری رسید را تأیید می‌کنند](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5453537/)

**۳. مکانیسم‌های جذب پوستی**

*آنچه مطالعات نشان می‌دهند:*

- [بی‌پی‌آ از طریق پوست جذب می‌شود - نرخ جذب ۲۵ درصد در ۲۴ ساعت](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- [بی‌پی‌اس جذب کمتری دارد - ۰.۴ درصد در ۲۴ ساعت (۶۰ برابر کندتر از بی‌پی‌آ)](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- [ضدعفونی‌کننده دست / کرم به‌طور چشمگیری جذب را افزایش می‌دهد (تا ۱۸۵ برابر)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4206219/)
- [بی‌پی‌آ از تماس پوستی بیشتر در بدن باقی می‌ماند نسبت به بی‌پی‌آ بلعیده شده (روزها در مقابل ساعات)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9210257/)
- [فقط ۲.۲ درصد بی‌پی‌آ اعمال شده پوستی از نظر سیستمیک در دسترس می‌شود](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9210257/)

**۴. انتقال به اشیاء دیگر**

*مستند شده:*

- [بی‌پی‌آ/بی‌پی‌اس از رسیدها به پول نقد، کارت‌ها و سایر اقلام در کیف پول منتقل می‌شود](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621184/)
- مواجهه ثانویه از اشیاء آلوده قابل اندازه‌گیری است

- [میل ترکیبی ضعیف است - هزاران برابر ضعیف‌تر از استروژن طبیعی](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1203574109)



### شواهد علمی: آنچه نامشخص است

**۱. اثرات سلامت انسانی در سطوح مواجهه واقعی**

*مشکل شواهد:*

- بیشتر اثرات سلامتی در مطالعات حیوانی یا کشت سلولی نشان داده می‌شود
- مطالعات از دوزهای اغلب بالاتر از مواجهه معمول انسانی استفاده می‌کنند
- مطالعات اپیدمیولوژیک انسانی ارتباطات را نشان می‌دهند اما نمی‌توانند علیت را اثبات کنند
- عوامل مخدوش‌کننده (رژیم غذایی، سبک زندگی، وضعیت اجتماعی-اقتصادی) سخت قابل تفکیک هستند

*اثرات ادعا شده با شواهد انسانی نامشخص:*

- چاقی و سندرم متابولیک
- دیابت نوع ۲
- اختلال عملکرد تولیدمثلی و ناباروری
- سرطان‌های خاص (سینه، پروستات)
- اختلالات رشد عصبی (ADHD، اختلالات یادگیری)
- بیماری قلبی عروقی

*چالش اساسی:* مطالعات حیوانی این اثرات را پیشنهاد می‌کنند، مطالعات مشاهده‌ای انسانی همبستگی‌ها را نشان می‌دهند، اما ایجاد علیت در انسان‌ها در دوزهای واقعی همچنان دشوار است.

**۲. مشکل تکرارپذیری**

*چرا این مهم است:*

تکرارپذیری برای اعتبار علمی اساسی است. اگر یک یافته نتواند به‌طور مستقل تکرار شود، ممکن است:

- یک اثر آماری (مثبت کاذب) باشد
- یک اثر از شرایط آزمایشی خاص باشد
- مشمول سوگیری انتشار باشد (فقط نتایج "مثبت" منتشر می‌شوند)
- تحت تأثیر انتظارات محقق یا روش‌شناسی باشد

*وضعیت بی‌پی‌آ:*

- [یک تحلیل مرکز تحلیل ریسک هاروارد در سال ۲۰۰۴ "هیچ شواهد مثبت ثابتی برای اثرات دوز کم بی‌پی‌آ" نیافت](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.7713)
- بسیاری از مطالعات بی‌پی‌آ که سرفصل شدند هرگز به‌طور مستقل تکرار نشده‌اند
- آزمایشگاه‌های مختلف با استفاده از روش‌های مختلف نتایج ناسازگار می‌گیرند
- این ثابت نمی‌کند که بی‌پی‌آ ایمن است، اما به این معنی است که نمی‌توانیم در مورد اثرات ادعایی خاص مطمئن باشیم

*نگرانی‌های تأمین مالی و سوگیری:*

- [مطالعات تأمین مالی شده توسط صنعت تمایل دارند بی‌پی‌آ را ایمن‌تر بیابند (حدود ۹۰ درصد هیچ اثری نمی‌یابند)](https://www.science.org/content/article/bpa-safety-war-battle-over-evidence)
- [مطالعات دانشگاهی / دولتی تمایل دارند آسیب بیابند (حدود ۹۰ درصد اثرات می‌یابند)](https://www.science.org/content/article/bpa-safety-war-battle-over-evidence)
- این می‌تواند نشان‌دهنده موارد زیر باشد:
  - سرکوب یا دستکاری صنعت
  - طراحی مطالعه بهتر در تحقیقات صنعتی (پروتکل‌های استاندارد شده)
  - سؤالات تحقیقاتی متفاوتی که پرسیده می‌شود
  - سوگیری انتشار در تحقیقات دانشگاهی

جامعه علمی در مورد چگونگی تفسیر این الگو همچنان تقسیم شده است.


**۳. تصویر مختلط از به عنوان جایگزین بهتر**

*آنچه می‌دانیم:*

- بی‌پی‌اس با آزمایش ایمنی حداقل به‌ عنوان گزینه "ایمن‌تر" معرفی شد
- [بی‌پی‌اس خواص اختلال هورمونی مشابه بی‌پی‌آ دارد](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4816743/)
- [بی‌پی‌اس ۶۰ برابر کندتر از بی‌پی‌آ از طریق پوست جذب می‌شود](https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/65/2/206/6031581)
- اما: [بی‌پی‌اس آهسته‌تر متابولیزه می‌شود، بنابراین بیشتر در شکل فعال باقی می‌ماند](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6792388/)
- اثر خالص بر سلامت انسان: واقعاً نامشخص

*سؤال کلیدی:* آیا جذب کندتر اما پایداری طولانی‌تر بهتر یا بدتر از جذب سریع‌تر با متابولیسم سریع‌تر است؟ ما یک پاسخ روشن نداریم.

**۴. رابطه دوز-پاسخ: نگرانی‌های غیر یکنواخت**

*فرض سم‌شناسی کلاسیک:* دوز بالاتر = اثر بیشتر

*واقعیت اختلال هورمونی:* [ممکن است از این الگو پیروی نکند](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3365860/)

- هورمون‌ها در غلظت‌های بسیار کم عمل می‌کنند
- دوزهای کوچک ممکن است اثراتی داشته باشند که دوزهای بزرگ ندارند[^nmdr-fa]
- زمان‌بندی مواجهه ممکن است بیشتر از مقدار مهم باشد
- روش‌های سم‌شناسی سنتی ممکن است این اثرات را از دست بدهند

*چرا این عدم قطعیت ایجاد می‌کند:*

- آزمایش ایمنی سنتی پاسخ دوز یکنواخت را فرض می‌کند
- اگر بی‌پی‌آ از این الگو پیروی نکند، محدودیت‌های ایمنی فعلی ممکن است بی‌ربط باشند
- اما اثرات غیر یکنواخت سخت‌تر برای مطالعه و تکرار هستند

**۵. ریسک واقعی فردی از رسیدها**

*آنچه اغراق شده:*

- "۱۰ ثانیه دستکاری از آستانه‌های ایمن فراتر می‌رود" - گمراه‌کننده زیرا آستانه‌های EFSA بسیار احتیاطی هستند
- "۴ دقیقه برای شستن آن" - به‌طور گسترده نقل شده اما منبع ضعیف
- رسیدها به‌عنوان ریسک اصلی فردی ارائه می‌شوند در حالی که مواجهه غذایی معمولاً بزرگ‌تر است

*آنچه واقعی است:*

- مواجهه شغلی برای صندوقدارانی که روزانه صدها رسید را دستکاری می‌کنند
- اثر تجمعی رسیدها به علاوه منابع غذایی
- ضدعفونی‌کننده دست که به‌طور چشمگیری جذب را تقویت می‌کند



### درک عدم قطعیت علمی

**"منطقه خاکستری" بودن به چه معناست؟**

عدم قطعیت علمی به معنای "ما هیچ چیز نمی‌دانیم" نیست. به این معنی است که ما داریم:

- مکانیسم‌های بیولوژیکی قابل‌قبول
- شواهد توصیفی اما نه قطعی
- تفسیرهای مورد مناقشه از داده‌های موجود
- نتیجه‌گیری‌های مختلف کارشناس بر اساس همان شواهد

**برای بی‌پی‌آ/بی‌پی‌اس، منطقه خاکستری شامل:**

۱. **قابلیت مکانیسمی:** ما می‌دانیم این مواد شیمیایی می‌توانند با سیستم‌های بیولوژیکی تعامل کنند

۲. **شواهد حیوانی:** اثرات در حیوانات آزمایشگاهی دیده می‌شود

۳. **ارتباطات مشاهده‌ای:** بی‌پی‌آ بالاتر با بیماری‌های خاص در انسان‌ها همبستگی دارد

۴. **عدم قطعیت علّی:** ما نمی‌توانیم به‌طور قطعی بگوییم بی‌پی‌آ این بیماری‌ها را در انسان‌ها در معرض‌های واقعی ایجاد می‌کند

**چگونه در مناطق خاکستری استدلال کنیم:**

*گزینه ۱: تقاضای اثبات قطعی قبل از اقدام*

- منتظر شواهد قطعی انسانی بمانید
- ریسک از دست دادن آسیب‌های واقعی در طول تأخیر
- مواجهه بالقوه در سطح جمعیت ادامه می‌یابد

*گزینه ۲: اعمال اصل احتیاط*

- بر اساس نگرانی قابل‌قبول حتی بدون اثبات قطعی عمل کنید
- ریسک محدودیت‌های غیر ضروری بر مواد شیمیایی مفید
- ممکن است هزینه‌های اقتصادی برای مزایای نامشخص متحمل شود

*گزینه ۳: احتیاط متناسب (از نظر علمی قابل دفاع‌ترین)*

- قوی‌ترین احتیاط برای آسیب‌پذیرترین‌ها (زنان باردار، نوزادان)
- استراتژی‌های کاهش متوسط برای جمعیت عمومی
- ادامه تحقیق برای حل عدم قطعیت‌ها
- ارزیابی مجدد منظم با تکامل شواهد

**اجماع علمی فعلی (چنانکه هست):**

بیشتر دانشمندان مستقل موافقند:

- بی‌پی‌آ/بی‌پی‌اس بی‌اثر نیستند - آنها فعالیت بیولوژیکی دارند
- کاهش احتیاطی مواجهه منطقی است
- مواجهه جنینی و نوزادی نگران‌کننده‌ترین است
- مواجهه بزرگسالان از رسیدهای گاه‌به‌گاه احتمالاً ریسک حداقلی است
- منابع غذایی نگرانی بزرگ‌تری نسبت به رسیدها برای بیشتر مردم هستند
- مطالعات انسانی بیشتر و بهتر مورد نیاز است

بیشتر دانشمندان مستقل در مورد موارد زیر اختلاف نظر دارند:

- آیا معرض‌های جمعیت فعلی باعث بیماری قابل اندازه‌گیری می‌شوند
- سطح "ایمن" واقعاً چیست
- آیا بی‌پی‌اس بهتر، بدتر یا معادل بی‌پی‌آ است
- چه وزنی به مطالعات حیوانی در مقابل مطالعات انسانی بدهیم



### نتیجه‌گیری نهایی

**ارزیابی علمی متعادل:**

**۱. برای زنان باردار و کودکان خردسال:** احتیاط کاملاً توجیه‌پذیر است. شواهد کافی است برای توصیه به کاهش حداقل مواجهه از طریق همه مسیرها (غذایی و پوستی). اصل احتیاط در اینجا مناسب است زیرا:

- پنجره‌های رشد به‌ویژه آسیب‌پذیر هستند
- اثرات ممکن است برگشت‌ناپذیر باشند
- هزینه اجتناب نسبتاً کم است

**۲. برای بزرگسالان (جمعیت عمومی):** ریسک از دستکاری گاه‌به‌گاه رسید احتمالاً در پیام‌رسانی سلامت عمومی اغراق شده است. نگرانی اصلی باید مواجهه غذایی باشد. شواهد پشتیبانی می‌کنند:

- تلاش‌های کاهش منطقی (ترجیح تازه به کنسرو، شیشه به پلاستیک)
- وحشت‌زده نشدن در مورد معرض‌های گاه‌به‌گاه
- شناخت عدم قطعیت باقی‌مانده

**۳. برای کارگران شغلی (صندوقداران):** این یک نگرانی سلامت شغلی واقعی است که نیاز به حفاظت‌های محل کار دارد:

- دستکاری روزانه صدها رسید
- مواجهه تجمعی در طول سال‌ها
- اغلب همراه با استفاده از ضدعفونی‌کننده دست
- مسئولیت کارفرما برای ارائه جایگزین‌های ایمن‌تر

**۴. درباره بی‌پی‌اس:** برچسب‌گذاری "بدون بی‌پی‌آ" گمراه‌کننده است - بی‌پی‌اس به‌نظر نگرانی‌های مشابهی دارد، فقط سینتیک متفاوت.

**برآوردهای بار بیماری جهانی به چه معناست:**

ادعاهایی مانند ["۱۲۷ میلیون مورد بیماری متابولیک قابل انتساب به بیسفنول‌ها"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725025379) هستند:

- پیش‌بینی‌های مبتنی بر مدل، نه موارد شمارش شده
- بر اساس روابط علّی فرضی
- مفید برای اولویت‌بندی سیاست
- معادل علیت فردی اثبات شده نیست



### توصیه‌های عملی

#### برای همه:

**اولویت ۱: کاهش مواجهه غذایی (مهم‌ترین)**

- غذاهای تازه یا منجمد را به جای کنسرو در صورت امکان انتخاب کنید
- از ظروف شیشه‌ای یا استیل به جای پلاستیک استفاده کنید
- هرگز غذا را در ظروف پلاستیکی در مایکروویو گرم نکنید
- مصرف غذاهای بسته‌بندی شده و فرآوری شده را کاهش دهید
- از بطری‌های آب پلاستیکی اجتناب کنید (به‌ویژه در ماشین‌های داغ)
- به دنبال قوطی‌هایی با برچسب "پوشش بدون بی‌پی‌آ" باشید (اما تشخیص دهید که ممکن است از بی‌پی‌اس استفاده کنند)

**اولویت ۲: مدیریت مواجهه رسید (اهمیت متوسط)**

- در صورت ارائه، رسید الکترونیکی درخواست کنید
- رسیدهای کاغذی را وقتی نیازی ندارید رد کنید
- اگر رسیدها را نگه می‌دارید:
  - آنها را در یک پاکت / جیب جداگانه ذخیره کنید (نه شل در کیف پول)
  - سمت چاپ شده را به داخل تا کنید
  - از پول نقد و کارت‌ها دور نگه دارید
- دست‌ها را با آب و صابون بعد از دستکاری رسیدها بشویید
- **هرگز** بلافاصله قبل از دستکاری رسیدها از ضدعفونی‌کننده دست استفاده نکنید
- همیشه قبل از خوردن بعد از لمس رسیدها دست‌ها را بشویید
- رسیدها را به کودکان ندهید که نگه دارند یا با آنها بازی کنند

**اولویت ۳: کاهش کلی پلاستیک**

- از پلاستیک‌های علامت‌گذاری شده با کد بازیافت #۷ (پلی‌کربنات) اجتناب کنید
- از ظروف پلاستیکی آسیب‌دیده یا خراش‌دار استفاده نکنید
- بطری‌های شیرخوری پلاستیکی را با شیشه یا استیل جایگزین کنید
- در صورت امکان از کاغذ موم یا شیشه به جای پوشش پلاستیکی استفاده کنید

#### برای زنان باردار و والدین کودکان خردسال:

همه موارد بالا، به علاوه:

- در مورد اجتناب از غذاهای کنسروی برای غذای کودک سخت‌گیرتر باشید
- از بطری‌های شیشه‌ای کودک به‌طور انحصاری استفاده کنید
- از اسباب‌بازی‌های دندان‌درآوردن پلاستیکی اجتناب کنید (سیلیکون، چوب یا لاستیک طبیعی را انتخاب کنید)
- اجازه ندهید کودکان رسیدها را دستکاری کنند
- در طول بارداری، مواجهه غیرضروری پلاستیک را به حداقل برسانید
- محصولات بدون بی‌پی‌آ/بی‌پی‌اس را در صورت موجود بودن انتخاب کنید (با شناخت محدودیت‌ها)

#### برای صندوقداران و کارگران خرده‌فروشی:

- درخواست کنید کارفرما به کاغذ رسید بدون فنول تغییر دهد
- در صورت دستکاری روزانه رسیدهای زیاد دستکش بپوشید
- زمان تماس با رسیدها را به حداقل برسانید
- بلافاصله قبل از دستکاری رسیدها از ضدعفونی‌کننده دست استفاده نکنید
- دست‌ها را کاملاً قبل از خوردن یا استراحت بشویید
- رسیدها را روی ظروف غذای داغ قرار ندهید
- برای سیستم‌های رسید الکترونیکی حمایت کنید

#### چه چیزی نگران نباشید:

- لمس گاه‌به‌گاه یک رسید: ریسک حداقل است
- خرید در فروشگاه‌ها: نیازی به اجتناب از محیط‌های خرده‌فروشی نیست
- تماس تصادفی با پلاستیک: روی منابع مواجهه بالا تمرکز کنید
- حذف کامل: واقع‌بینانه یا ضروری نیست

**توجه:** این سند نشان‌دهنده ترکیبی از ادبیات علمی فعلی تا فوریه ۲۰۲۶ است. درک علمی به تکامل ادامه می‌دهد، و توصیه‌ها ممکن است با ظهور شواهد جدید تغییر کند.

[^nmdr-fa]: در سم‌شناسی کلاسیک، آسیب با دوز به‌صورت خطی افزایش می‌یابد: بیشتر ماده، بیشتر آسیب، در یک منحنی *یکنواخت* ساده. هورمون‌ها متفاوت عمل می‌کنند: آنها به‌عنوان *سیگنال* عمل می‌کنند و گیرنده‌ها در شدت‌های مختلف سیگنال، واکنش‌های متفاوتی نشان می‌دهند. یک دوز کوچک بی‌پی‌آ ممکن است یک سیگنال استروژن ضعیف را تقلید کرده و واکنش سلولی را تحریک کند؛ یک دوز بزرگ ممکن است بدن را وادار کند که همان گیرنده‌ها را *کاهش‌تنظیم* کند (سرکوب کند) و اثر را خنثی کند. نتیجه: دوزهای پایین می‌توانند تغییرات قابل‌اندازه‌گیری در مطالعات ایجاد کنند در حالی که دوزهای بالا این کار را نمی‌کنند، برعکس آنچه آزمایش ایمنی سنتی انتظار دارد. از آنجایی که حدود نظارتی با آزمایش دوزهای بالا تعیین می‌شوند و فرض می‌کنند دوزهای پایین‌تر نسبتاً ایمن‌تر هستند، این الگو، اگر واقعی باشد، می‌تواند به این معنی باشد که استانداردهای فعلی آسیب‌های واقعی دوز پایین را نادیده می‌گیرند. مکانیسم در زیست‌شناسی هورمونی به‌خوبی ثابت شده است؛ اینکه آیا برای بی‌پی‌آ در معرض‌های واقعی انسانی اعمال می‌شود همچنان فعالانه مورد بحث است.
