# House Hunting Shenanigans
[This is not a typical blog post, hence the weird format, likely not good for reading on the phone. It is a representations of events happening and my thoughts on them.]

So, I've been looking for a house for almost a year now. It's been way longer than I expected and the market has been weird, to say the least. But just for the context, there are a lot of houses that come to the market and stay for a loooooong time and there are some that are gone in usually 1-2 days. I've just had one of the most informative experiences of my life in the past two days. Here is what happend, and how I think about it.

- N is my realtor
- J is the seller's realtor
- C is J's partner
- L is J and C's assistant

    <td>N thinks the other offer might be better, suggests if I want to increase the price. I don't think that's the case, I drop the offer by 20K from the asking price and remove most of those sweet things I'd put in the original offer. N strongly advises me against doing it. I do it anyways.</td>

    <td>In the mean time the name of the seller's realtor J on the REW website is changed to her partner's C, and in fact, her name is removed from all her listings (a total of 4)!. I'm guessing the seller is really pissed at the realtor that they've lost 20K just like that and they don't want to work with her anymore. But I'm not sure why her name would be removed from all other listings. In the meantime she was busy with showings of a $3.5M house too.</td>

    <td>I ask N what kind of morons are these people? He thinks the other offer is actually at this price but there might be a condition in there that they don't like it and they want to work with me instead. I don't buy any of it.

I tell him I believe they could get an offer at 45K below and with competing they probably could have brought them up to 30K below, but I'm almost certain they don't have anything above that and I might want to actually reduce it even more. He gets angry and says I shouldn't. I then tell him that I'm ok with 10K below and that's best and final offer.</td>

        <br><br>Sunday 9am, from N to JCL: Good morning, L, J and C, Please see the attached offer on [...]. The dates have adjusted to meet your client’s preference. This is my client’s best an final offer. Thank you, N
        <br><br>Sunday 1pm, from L to N: I just realized that this Offer has expired. Why on earth would you send a completely new Offer on a Sunday morning with less than 2 hours for the Sellers to respond?  That seems very unprofessional to me, and certainly not in the best interest of your Clients. ~L. Unlicensed Assistant to J-C
        <br><br>Sunday 1pm, from N to L: Hello L, I informed C last night that we would be submitting an offer first thing in the morning. I sent the offer, a touch base and text messages first thing in the morning. The offer you sent us last night was submitted at 9:15 PM and open till 11 PM. The offer we sent you this morning was sent at 9:15 AM and open till 11 AM. You are free to accept the new offer and extend the time for signing. Cheer, N
        <br><br>Sunday 1pm, from L to N: The Offer we sent to you last night was already fully signed, so much less response time required from your Clients. It just bothers me as a member of the Public, who has been working in real Estate Admin positions in V. for over 37 years, to see a Realtor not doing their best for their Clients. Your turn around time was not reasonable. L
        <br><br>Sunday 1:30pm, from N to L: Hello L, Professional and to your client’s interest service would have been to work with our excellent Full Price offer on Friday night / Saturday morning. Instead your team stalled and ended up with a 2nd and 3rd offers your clients are not interested in. The offer you have from us is exactly as my client wants it presented. The timeline was tight because even with 3 realtors your team has shown that they are not able work with us in a timely manner. Instead of spending time lobbing insults how about getting the job done? All the best, N

Likely Monday after 5:30, and if you don't mind in your office. Please let me know if that's possible. Cheers, K</td>

In regards to presenting an offer in person this never happens. This is why both sellers and purchasers hire independent representation. It’s frustrating in this situation in that I don’t think this team is doing a solid job of representing their clients. The right hand maybe not knowing what the left hand is doing? They most certainly have the legal obligation to present your offer and the seller is ultimately responsible to make a decision on what to do with it. You can send them this offer again tonight open for a few hours if you want to? </td>

And now they are saying they want to open the closed doors again by pretending the assistant didn't see it on time, sure. OK, I get it, they wanted to try the whole weekend, and lucky for them I didn't have another house in mind to write an offer on, because I totally would. Anyways, what has happened over the weekend gave me a ton of valuable information which I really appreciate, whether this transaction happens or not. I'm certainly not writing another offer, I will not have an open offer for any period of time, so it is either what you mentioned happening or what I asked as an in person thing, whether it has every happened before or not is none of my concerns. What I know is that I'm not giving them another chance to try to find another competing offer. I've done more than enough in that regard. K</td>

    <td>I send this to my realtor: Hi N, What a weekend that was. Thank you very much for working so patiently with me, and I'm sorry you had to deal with those unprofessional behaviors. Anyways, this was a great experience for me and I learned a lot. Going forward I would like to make a couple of changes: please do not volunteer any information regarding existing or competing offers on any property to me unless I explicitly ask for it. Also, any time that a seller's agent mentions an existing or competing offer please ask them to provide that in writing in form of the disclosure letter. I think this will immensely help me make better decisions and have a smoother process. Cheers, K</td>
    <td>Feels like there are a million levers that realtors have to push you to increase the price, even when everything is pointing the other way, which makes sense. They want the deal to close and as a buyer I have more chance of doing that if I increase the price, hence the push. But I don't want to pay extra 5-10% for a house just because others (maybe) are willing to do so. And it takes energy to distill all information and remove noise that influences my decision in the heat of back and forth in negotiations.</td>

Final thoughts:

- There was this other house that I was interested in about 7 months ago. I wrote an offer at a price I was comfortable with and which I thought that house is worth. He again pushed me multiple times to go 5-10% more which I didn't. The house was just sold for 5% more than my price, but keep in mind it took 7 months. In this case I couldn't really afford it at that price.

- I had to dig a bit and figured out the seller is a marketing and sales person who teaches car dealerships how to sell cars. Interpret that however you wish.

- It feels like the realtors have created this system that works fine for them, and the buyers and sellers now have to obey by how they work and in this, they basically are playing with us as pawns in their chess game. I know I'm exaggerating quite a bit, but the feeling is there. Not sure what can be done about this situation. For most people they just want to buy/sell a house and don't want to engage with the situation that much. But I find that counterproductive. We as a society have given up on so many things, a phone holder bought from amazon is not worth fighting for, let amazon do what they are doing, a laptop bought from bestbuy is not worth fighting for, let them do whatever, a stock from stockexchange is not worth fighting for, we don't even know how the stock market works, let them be, a tax return is not worth fighting for, just pay whatever the app tells you, a car bought from a dealership is not worth fighting for, this is what's available in the market, and a house bought/sold is not worth fighting for, realtors know what they're doing. I feel as if we spend hours and hours of our lived "negotiating" on the smallest things from a phone holder to a house, but when it comes to fixing the processes we don't even want to talk about it. It is so wrong.

An analysis of what worked and what didn't using Claude 3.5 haiku

- SUCCESSES:
    - Information Gathering Effectiveness
        - Successfully identified when competing offers were likely bluffs
        - Accurately predicted market behavior (reference to previous house that took 7 months to sell)
        - Avoided overpaying due to FOMO or pressure
    - Price Protection
        - Maintained discipline on maximum price point
        - Avoided emotional escalation in bidding
        - Referenced past example validates this approach: previous house - they didn't overbid on took 7 months to sell at their original valuation
    - Learning & Adaptation
        - Developed concrete improvements (requesting written disclosure of competing offers)
        - Identified specific process improvements
        - Realtor validated some strategic choices ("N calls, he says he thinks I did the right thing and he thanks me for doing so")
- FAILURES:
    - Transaction Completion
        - No house purchased
        - Multiple failed negotiations
        - Time spent without achieving primary goal
    - Professional Relationships
        - Created tension with selling agents
        - Generated unprofessional responses
        - May have damaged future negotiating positions
- NEUTRAL/CONTEXT-DEPENDENT:
    - Time Pressure Tactics
        - Sometimes created leverage
        - Sometimes backfired
        - Effectiveness appears situation-dependent
    - Price Reduction Strategy
        - Created psychological impact
        - But may have prevented deal completion
        - Unknown if this helped or hurt long-term

Recommendations:

    - Market analysis approach
    - Price discipline
    - Information verification requirements
    - Learning system approach
- Modify:
    - Timeline flexibility (less rigid deadlines)
    - Communication style (more professional)
    - Relationship management (less adversarial)
- Add:
    - Clear success metrics beyond just price
    - Relationship building strategies
    - Alternative paths to deal completion
