# Looking for a monitor

I've had two monitors on my desk for my work for the past few years which I combine with my laptop for a 3-screen workstation. It works fine, except one of the monitors has started flickering for a while now and even a few pixels are dead. So I decided to look for another one, and I might even reduce the number of screens to two since it seems like I'm using one of the side monitors more than others and hence getting neck and back pain. That's another story and I have to ergonomicize my work habits.

Asking around, one of the recommendations is [Dell UltraSharp 43 - U4323QE](https://www.amazon.ca/Dell-UltraSharp-USB-C-Hub-Monitor/dp/B0BHYV5NXD) monitor, but that is way over my budget. So, looking on similar models I found the [Dell Curved Gaming 34 - S3422DWG](https://www.amazon.ca/Dell-S3422DWG-Curvature-Grey-Grey/dp/B095X7RV77) which seems nice but I'm not sure about the curved part of it. While seems it was the hype for a while, I've heard a lot of people not liking them for some reason. I'm not sure if I'd like it or not. So, still looking.

Sima also recommended [ARZOPA 2.5K Portable Monitor 16"](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CH9XR3G4) portable one for working on the go.

On that note, someone also recommended the [LG CineBeam](https://www.lg.com/us/projectors/lg-hu710pw-projector) for watching movies at home. I don't remember who it was though!
