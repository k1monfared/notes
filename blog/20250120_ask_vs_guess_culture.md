# Ask Culture vs. Guess Culture

Someone was talking about this that these came up:
- [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map)
- [Navigating ‘Ask’ and ‘Guess’ Cultures in a modern world](https://medium.com/redhill-review/navigating-ask-and-guess-cultures-in-a-modern-world-30b167f8ab09)

Seems relevant to a lot of things! Will read that book and report later.
