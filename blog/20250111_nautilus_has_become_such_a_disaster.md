# **Nautilus has become such a disaster**

And that's partly because Ubuntu has become such a disaster. If only I could find reliable drivers for my GPU on any other linux distribution, I'd never go back to it.

- You can't create a new file in the browser
- you can't change the default app that opens a file type
- the list view doesn't exist anymore
- the detailed view columns are not fixed
- And now I can even install a crappy app like Caja even to use instead!!

- Thunar seems to be a simple replacement for old nautiuls. It is in the standard repos.
- Sunflower also seems a nice double panel one: https://sunflower-fm.org
  - Couldn't get it to work at first try.
