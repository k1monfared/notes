# Memoir of a Snail

The other day Marjan recommended the movie [Memoir of a Snail](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23770030/) and as I was going to find an watch it, the website recommended another movie called [Diary of a Nymphomaniac](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1111890/). Everything about it seemed way below average, but still the storyline was interesting, so I watched it. Though it was trying to be erotic, it was not a good one it at. The conversations were at best cliche, and there was nothing really good about the story either. But one of the things I like about the movie is how well they pose a question. Sometimes, they might not even know they are doing it, like this one, but they still do a good job of it. So, I wouldn't really recommend the movie as a movie, but as a starting point for a conversation is a good one I guess, 6/10.

Bt let's get back to the Memoir of a Snail. One funny thing was that after watching the two movies back to back, the day afetr I was mixing the lines, conversations, and events of the two movie. It seems like the two had nothing in common together but still there were enough in common that I could mix them up. Also, could be related to my brain being tired, but I think there's a bit more to that. Anyways, the Memoir of a Snail is a very nice movie. The stroy is very touching and sad but doesn't ask for pity, which is great. There's a lot of quirkiness in it in a fun way which I didn't think I'd like but I did, and the humor is subtle and cool. I really liked this one and recommend it as a whole.
