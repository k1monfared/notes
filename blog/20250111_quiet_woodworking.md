# **In Search for a quite table saw**

## **But Why**
So I've been looking for a house for quite a while now, and one of the minimum requirements that I have for it is the ability to do as much woodworking as I want, and an added plus if I can do it whenever I want. Unfortunately, this doesn't give me many options. It usually means I should find a place that has a double garage (not terribly rare in my price range) or a big workshop (somewhat rare) but also to be far away from neighbors so that when I make noise, they won't hear much of it (quite rare). Unless I want to live in a huge land, which again is not something in my price range, or I should be comfortable with the risk of isolation, e.g. by living in a farm far away from the town. The other option is having a huge but accessible basement which then I'll have to invest in good dust collection.

The other day Natan told me that his father has suggested to instead of looking for a house that fits my requirements, I can find a house that has the space, but in terms of isolation I can then invest in quite equipment. While it will not eliminate the noise, it will help reduce it, and I might be able to just get away with it. It seems actually a better investemnt too, first I get a house that other people would also find utility in it later when I want to sell it, second, I get to justify the cost of higher end woodworking equipment!

## **Ongoing search**
Unfortunately there aren't much data about the noise each tool makes. It also depends on what material you're working with, and also on the setup and maintenance of them. But I've got to start somewhere.

First, there's this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5ec6hsEnL4) that talks about the lack of such data, and their initial try to collect some. The data is not very helpful though, but it is a starting point.
