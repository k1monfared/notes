            - 2021-11-09: There's not many books that I recommend to "everyone", but with this one I think really everyone should read it. As long as you understand basic highschool math, you can follow it through. I started following Carl on Twitter and when the book came out I ordered it right away. I'm a slow reader, so it took me about a year to finish it, but it is one of those books that gives shape to a lot of thoughts, frustrations, ideas, and tricks that you have dealing with everyday people, from your friendly neighbor, to that deceptive news reporter. The book explains in plain text how people can and do abuse scientific formalism to pretend what they say is correct. It argued that it sometimes comes from bad intent, but also a lot of times comes from incompetence.  I wish the book spent more time explaining how to refute bullshit, but then the name of the book would have been different. Although the entire last chapter is about just that.  Read the book and you'll never look at a "scientists/studies showed ..." article the same way as you used to. You'll also probably never believe any news you hear ever again, whether it is correct or not, and for a good reason! And also, you'll never get all pumped up about the new invention your cousin thinks is going to change the world.  Oh, did I mention? There's about zero errors in the book. At least that's how many I found.

            2021-11-22: This is the last fiction I've read and it's been 6-7 years since. I can't say much about the book, except one just needs to read it to understand what it is about. However, I can warn you that it will take some psychological toll, it is not an easy book and many of my friends and myself have had repeated dreams about it during and after reading it! Dostoevsky knows what he is doing with your mind and he does it artfully.  To digress a bit here, there are two interesting points of view on the role of emotion/subconscious in fiction that I know if. Brecht believes a novel/play should pause, let the audience think, and keep them rational, not provoke emotions, etc. He warns about the negative effects of the potential extreme abuse of the masses when the plot tends to make the audience emotional and he's wary of that. On the other hand, there is Checkov who thinks all there is for a novel to do is to get under the skin of the audience and to play with their minds, and use their emotions to get them to act, to build a better place probably. I tend to agree with both, and I only let the authors that I completely trust do the latter with me. And the reason that I'm blabbering about all this is that Dostoevsky is the only one who I trust enough in this regard.

            - 2022-11-27: I learned about the book from the animation based on this book, and while I found it a nice movie to watch, the details were a bit cheesy and holywood-like. So, I always recommend the film to friends with a few words of caution first. I stumbled upon the book on my friend's bookshelf and they let me borrow it, and starting from the first few pages I got hooked. Unlike the film, the book is a personal account of what happened to Marjane during those years, it feels honest, to the point, and with the right amount of details that makes you develop a sense of the situation at the time, it doesn't try to convince you that everyone had the same experience, but quite opposite, it shows that different people were experiencing very different things, and tries to be as open as a teenage girl in that situation can be, reflecting on others' emotions and situations. In the wake of what's happening these days in Iran, it was a good point of reference for me to have since as a boy, I haven't come to fully appreciate what girls go through in my country, and this helped a bit, maybe it could serve as a starting point to enquire more. All in all, it is an excellent book, engaging, and hard to put down.

    [x] The Psychology of Money
        - review
            - The summary on goodreads by Riku Sayuj pretty much sums it up. The book is engaging with a lot of relevant examples. One important thing is that this is not a book about investment. It's about how to think about money, and in general many things in life. It tries to put into perspective a lot of misconceptions people tend to have about how economic growth works, and what a sane financial decision is, etc, and it does a very good job of it. One little thing that gets a bit annoying is that the author likes to throw numbers like 0.000000000001 at the reader often, which don't seem like to serve any point. Anyways, most of the things mentioned in the book are generally common sense and with the caveats that he mentions are good advice. It does help build a bigger picture of how money and the mentality around it work and gives directions to prepare to invest more in the topic (pun not intended). There are a few points that though with disclaimers the author offers investment ideas, again, generally good advice, but somewhat contradictory to the premise of the book.  One of the things that the book argued about early on that got me interested in following it to the end is that it advises avoiding thinking about this or that person as "great" investors and trying to mimic their behavior or portfolio. Similarly, it often tries to promote a culture of having a personal understanding and planning of your finances than falling into rat races or just blindly following others, which again, are sane advice and common sense, but it really hammers it down.  There are a few places in the book that if you take the sentences out of the particular context, it contradicts what is previously mentioned in the book, which is fine, since they should be taken within the context. But, there seems to be a meager desire in the book to become a series of quotes that people throw at each other (like the summary by Riku Sayuj) which in that case becomes a problem!

    [x] Stumbling on happiness
        - review:
            The book is relatively slow. it tries to discuss an idea, it has a hard time clarifying the concept, then goes on and on elaborating the same thing without really making the idea any clearer. There seems to be some merit to the book, it definitely shows interesting points of view, it's not a wishy-washy book of feel-good vibes etc, and it is not a self-help book, but rather it tries to explain some complicated concepts, the only problem is it doesn't seem like the author knows the concept that well himself. It looks more like an effort by the author to lay down the pieces of a big puzzle one by one in order for himself to understand what the picture is, it is not clear that by the end of the book he’ll get there though. But he still publishes the book. The book references a lot of research and otherwise articles, however the results of those research papers are very liberally interpreted to support a point that the author tries to make, which reduces the credibility of the author. There are also a lot of ideas that are only touched on and not explored in more details, not for the reader, but seems like even the author hasn’t done it for themselves, before starting to write about it. It’s fine, but again, makes one question whether they want to read the book to the end or not. For example, in chapter 2 he talks about how two different people can have different scales of happiness, or have the same scales but rank things differently. It’s an interesting idea, he spends lots of time explaining it, but at the end it is a half cooked idea, and does not add much to the discussion he is having. I mean, you could have a conversation about such thing with your friends over a bottle of beer and it would sound amazing, but to put it in a book I think it should be worked on a bit more. Also, I’m not hoping that he’ll come back to it in later chapters, we’ll have to wait and see.

        - review:
            2023-03-26: I'm still reading the book, but after the introduction where she talks about her 2x2 the book quickly takes another turn. Maybe she wrote the introduction long after she wrote the early chapters, maybe later in the book she comes back to say some more helpful things, but as soon as the book starts she starts creating idols out of some of the worst managers history has seen and then tries to use that to give herself credit. I got interested in the book after I learned about the 2x2: caring personally and challenging directly. But the first few chapters don't have anything to do with it. On the other hand, they try to provide politically correct justifications for abusive behavior of managers of their reports. It is full of anecdotes about person x who is the CEO of the big company has done y and how that is a great thing, and how Kim has been asked to coach person x. There are a lot dangerous things in there which probably shapes the minds of a lot of higher and probably lower level managers in big tech companies. In that sense it is informative to read the book to understand where that mindset comes from, and maybe try to find a solution for it, but the book so far has been only trying to normalize those behaviors and to remove some of the symptoms that would enable one to diagnose them. Addressing symptoms rather than curing a problem is becoming more common and is a big dangerous trait which is spreading.
            Comparing this to "thanks for the feedback" you can see how immature her thoughts are. She keeps saying 20 years ago I did this and that as a manager and that was a mistake. I should give her credit for that. But then she quickly jumps to the next thought that has come to her after realizing she was doing something wrong and now preaches that as the best thing that everyone should do, and then goes on to theorize why it is a good thing to do. If I assume her naive, I would guess it has never occurred to her that her current thoughts and processes might be wrong too, maybe as bad as her previous ways, or even worse. But she sounds like a very smart person, and according to her, she has worked with many smart people too, so, I could only guess that she has a different agenda that I'm not understanding from reading the book.
            One side thing that keeps bothering me is that she says a story about her beloved dog and how a stranger on the street showed her radical candor by telling her how to treat her dog. The thing that bothers me is that I've read the exact same story in "thanks for the feedback", but they don't mention anyone's name, it's a generic example there. Now, it's quite possible that this story has really happened to Kim and it is a small world and it has shown up in the other book too, but it just keeps bothering me.
            So, all in all, instead of the slogan of the book on how to "Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity", the book so far has been about how to be a kickass boss without losing the image of someone who cares. Of course there are a lot of positive things one can take out of the book, but the book is not trying to offer that directly.
