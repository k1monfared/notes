                    Bow Glacier Falls
                        - Hiking
                        - easy hike, starts flat and picks up a bit at the end, but it is wonderful to see the glaciers that feed the bwo river.

                    Goat Creek
                        - mountain biking
                        - It's too long and boring for a hike, you can start from either end and end at the other one. Not the most exciting one, but if you want to try mountain biking for the first time, and not a fan of slopes or narrow trails, this is a good place to give it a shot.

                    Ha Ling Peak (AKA China man peak)
                        - pretty hard hike, and quite steep, a good portion of it is on the ridge and you're exposed. Definitely not recommended on a windy/rainy day. Even on a good day you might want to have your wind breaker and/or rain jacket with you.

                    Bow falls and bow river
                        - walk/hike
                        - From the town of Banff you can walk to the Bow river and walk on either side of it. Each side has its own unique views and depending on the depth of the water you might see the rock formations. On the south side you can get to the bottom of the falls and take beautiful photos, on the north side you can get on top of the falls and feel how majestic it is. Also, the walk along the river specially at night and crossing the lit wooden bridge is pretty nice.

                    Johnston Canyon
                        - hiking
                        - quite an easy stroll in the summer and moderate in the winter with packed snow. There's always a foot traffic there. Beset to get the as early as possible in the morning and do the hike. The trip to the first two waterfalls is pretty quick, and then it takes a bit more to get to the ink pots. Definitely take the routes to the falls to see them up close. The ink pots are not as grandiose as the ones in Yellowstone, but still quite fun.

                    Heart Creek
                        - trail walking
                        - relative easy walk along the creek. The creek was displaced after the 2013 flood, and so did the trail a little bit. It is quite short and ends at a hidden waterfall. Get to the fall if you don't mind getting wet and cold.

                    Heart Mountain
                        - hiking
                        - relatively hard and requires some route finding

                    Castle Mountain
                        - Hiking
                        - Moderate hike, when you get there you'll know why it is called the castle mountain

                    Lake Minnewanka
                        - picnic (summer) and cross country (winter)
                        - A quite popular place for picnic and walk in the summer and cross country across the lake in the winter.
                    Tunnel Mountain
                        - hiking
                        - an easy hike with good views. Close to the Banff centre, and

                    Grassi Lakes
                        - Hiking
                        - relatively easy hike with beautiful trees and views. The lake views are gorgeous. You can get to the lake almost from the road too, if you just want to see it, but that wouldn't be as exciting.

                    Lillian and Galatea Lakes
                        - Hiking, backpacking
                        - a relatively hard hike for a day hike, but with amazing rewards

                    Spray Lakes
                        - Any hikes around here are great. Many of them are pretty hard, several on the ridges. The lake itself is a spot for ice fishing in the winter. The road to here is not paved.
                    Beaver Creek
                        - Cross country and mountain biking
                Lake Louise
                    Lake Agnes Tea House and the plain of six glaciers
                        - hiking
                        - It's a pretty steep switchback to the teahouse from the lake, but it is very short, if you are in for a challenge continue to the other teahouse and the plain of six glaciers, but for that you need to be prepared as it gets hard very quickly. You can also directly hike to the glaciers which is easier than going through the teahouses.

                    Banff Centre for Arts
                        - A unique place which is the home to the Banff Mountain film and book festival. It hosts a lot of artists around the year, and there are usually performances, dances, and concerts during the weekends and the week. It's where you can find the future artists. There is a building that hosts mathematics workshops year round, but they are by invitation only! The food at Maclab is decent but a bit pricey. The Vistas dining hall on the other hand is worth every penny. It is a buffet style place with really good food and amazing views year round.

                    Cascade of Time Garden
                        - a pretty garden with nice flowers and a building with nice architecture.
                    Banff Trading Post
                        - One of the most amazing gift shops I've been to. Has lots of indigenous crafts, and sometimes you can find even deer skin etc. The prices are very reasonable.

                    Fairmont Banff Springs
                        The iconic hotel of Banff. It is worth taking a walk around and inside, and maybe to spend some time at the tea room.
